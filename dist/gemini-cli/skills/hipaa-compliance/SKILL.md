# HIPAA Compliance — Engineering Implementation

## When to use this skill

- Setting up HIPAA-compliant infrastructure
- Implementing required safeguards
- Conducting risk assessment
- Selecting BAA-eligible vendors
- Designing PHI access controls
- Preparing for compliance audit

## Three Safeguard Categories (Security Rule)

```
HIPAA Security Rule
│
├─ Administrative (more than half of controls)
│  Policy, training, sanctions, BAAs
│
├─ Physical
│  Facility access, workstations, devices, media
│
└─ Technical
   Access controls, audit, integrity, transmission
```

## Administrative Safeguards (Required)

### 1. Security Management Process
- ✅ Annual risk analysis (documented)
- ✅ Risk management plan
- ✅ Sanction policy (consequences for violations)
- ✅ Information system activity review (audit log review)

### 2. Assigned Security Responsibility
- ✅ Named Security Officer (job description)
- ✅ Named Privacy Officer

### 3. Workforce Security
```
Hire → Authorization → Clearance → Active → Termination

Each step has procedure:
- Background checks
- Access provisioning aligned with role
- Periodic access reviews
- Same-day deprovisioning on termination
```

### 4. Information Access Management
- ✅ Isolating clearinghouse functions
- ✅ Access authorization
- ✅ Access establishment + modification

### 5. Security Awareness + Training
- ✅ Security reminders (periodic)
- ✅ Protection from malicious software
- ✅ Login monitoring
- ✅ Password management

### 6. Security Incident Procedures
- ✅ Response + reporting plan
- ✅ Documented + tested

### 7. Contingency Plan
- ✅ Data backup plan
- ✅ Disaster recovery plan
- ✅ Emergency mode operation
- ✅ Testing + revision
- ✅ Applications + data criticality analysis

### 8. Evaluation
- ✅ Periodic technical + non-technical evaluation
- ✅ Document changes triggering re-evaluation

### 9. Business Associate Contracts
- ✅ Written contracts (BAAs)
- ✅ Track all vendors with PHI access

## Physical Safeguards

### 1. Facility Access Controls
- ✅ Contingency operations
- ✅ Facility security plan
- ✅ Access control + validation
- ✅ Maintenance records

### 2. Workstation Use
- ✅ Policies on appropriate use
- ✅ Screen privacy filters in shared areas

### 3. Workstation Security
- ✅ Physical protection (locks, location)
- ✅ Auto-lock screensavers

### 4. Device + Media Controls
- ✅ Disposal procedures (sanitization)
- ✅ Media re-use procedures
- ✅ Accountability (track devices)
- ✅ Data backup + storage

## Technical Safeguards (where engineers live most)

### 1. Access Control
```typescript
// Required:
- Unique user identification
- Emergency access procedure (break-the-glass)

// Addressable (effectively required):
- Automatic logoff after inactivity (15 min default)
- Encryption + decryption
```

Implementation:
```typescript
// MFA required for PHI access
function authenticate(creds: Credentials): Session {
  const user = verifyPassword(creds);
  requireMFA(user);  // TOTP, push, hardware key
  return createSession(user, { timeout: 15 * 60 }); // 15 min idle
}

// Auto-logoff
session.onIdle(15 * 60, () => {
  session.invalidate();
  redirectToLogin();
});
```

### 2. Audit Controls
```typescript
// Log EVERY PHI access
interface AuditEntry {
  id: string;
  timestamp: Date;          // UTC
  userId: string;
  patientId: string;        // resource accessed
  action: 'READ' | 'WRITE' | 'DELETE' | 'EXPORT';
  resource: string;         // table.id
  ipAddress: string;
  userAgent: string;
  reasonForAccess?: string; // treatment, payment, operations
  succeeded: boolean;
}

// Append-only, retained 6 years minimum
```

### 3. Integrity
```typescript
// Detect unauthorized PHI alteration
- Database constraints (check constraints, FK)
- Application-level validation
- Cryptographic checksums for archives
- Audit log immutability (append-only DB or WORM storage)
```

### 4. Person or Entity Authentication
- ✅ Verify identity before access
- ✅ MFA recommended

### 5. Transmission Security
```
Required:
- TLS 1.2+ for all PHI in transit
- No PHI in URLs/query strings
- No PHI in unencrypted email/SMS

Addressable (effectively required):
- Encryption at rest (AES-256)
- Integrity controls
```

## Cloud + BAA Vendor Selection

| Vendor | BAA available? | Notes |
|--------|:--------------:|-------|
| **AWS** | ✅ | Most services BAA-eligible |
| **Azure** | ✅ | Most services BAA-eligible |
| **GCP** | ✅ | HIPAA-eligible services list |
| **Cloudflare** | ✅ (Enterprise) | |
| **Sentry** | ✅ | |
| **Datadog** | ✅ | |
| **GitHub** | ✅ (Enterprise) | |
| **Slack** | ✅ (Enterprise+) | |
| **Stripe** | ⚠️ Specific products | |
| **OpenAI** | ⚠️ ZDR + BAA available | |
| **Anthropic** | ✅ via API on AWS | |
| **Various startups** | ❌ Often no | Check before using |

**Critical:** PHI on a non-BAA service = breach.

## Encryption Patterns

### At rest
```yaml
# RDS
StorageEncrypted: true
KmsKeyId: alias/phi-data-key

# S3
ServerSideEncryptionConfiguration:
  - SSEAlgorithm: aws:kms
    KMSMasterKeyID: alias/phi-data-key

# Backup
KmsKeyId: alias/phi-data-key
```

### In transit
- TLS 1.2+ everywhere
- Internal service-to-service: mTLS or TLS
- No HTTP-only ports
- HSTS headers

### Application-level (additional)
```typescript
// Sensitive fields encrypted before write
const encrypted = await kms.encrypt({
  KeyId: PHI_KEY,
  Plaintext: ssn,
});
await db.patients.update(id, { ssn_encrypted: encrypted.CiphertextBlob });
```

## Access Control: Role-Based Example

```typescript
// HIPAA: Minimum necessary access

interface Role {
  name: string;
  permissions: Permission[];
}

const ROLES: Role[] = [
  {
    name: 'physician',
    permissions: [
      'phi:read:own_patients',
      'phi:write:own_patients',
      'orders:create',
    ]
  },
  {
    name: 'nurse',
    permissions: [
      'phi:read:assigned_patients',
      'phi:update:limited',  // vitals, notes
    ]
  },
  {
    name: 'billing_staff',
    permissions: [
      'phi:read:billing_codes_only',  // minimum necessary
      'claims:create',
    ]
  },
  {
    name: 'admin',
    permissions: [
      // NO direct PHI access by default
      // Break-the-glass for emergencies, logged + reviewed
    ]
  },
];
```

## Logging: What NOT to log

```python
# ❌ Bad: PHI in logs
logger.info(f"Loaded patient: {patient_dict}")

# ✅ Good: Log IDs only
logger.info(f"Loaded patient: id={patient_id}")

# ❌ Bad: PHI in error messages
raise Exception(f"Invalid SSN {ssn} for patient")

# ✅ Good: Generic
raise Exception(f"Invalid SSN for patient {patient_id}")
```

**Audit logs themselves contain PHI references** (patient IDs). Treat them with same protections.

## Breach Notification Thresholds

```
< 500 individuals affected:
  - Notify individuals within 60 days
  - Notify OCR annually (by Feb 1)

500+ individuals affected:
  - Notify individuals within 60 days
  - Notify OCR within 60 days
  - Notify prominent media outlets within 60 days
```

## Risk Assessment Template

```markdown
| Asset | Threat | Vulnerability | Likelihood | Impact | Risk | Existing Controls | Recommendation |
|-------|--------|---------------|:----------:|:------:|:----:|------------------|----------------|
| Patient DB | Unauthorized access | Weak passwords | 🟡 Med | 🔴 High | 🔴 H | MFA, RBAC | Add behavioral analytics |
| Backup tapes | Theft | Physical access | 🟢 Low | 🔴 High | 🟡 M | Encryption | Continue current |
```

## Quick HIPAA Compliance Checklist

### Engineering
- [ ] All PHI encrypted at rest (AES-256)
- [ ] All PHI encrypted in transit (TLS 1.2+)
- [ ] MFA for all PHI access
- [ ] Auto-logoff after 15 min inactivity
- [ ] Audit log for every PHI access
- [ ] Audit logs append-only, 6-year retention
- [ ] Backup + DR plan tested annually
- [ ] No PHI in non-production environments
- [ ] No PHI in logs / error messages
- [ ] All BAAs in place

### Process
- [ ] Annual risk assessment
- [ ] Annual workforce training
- [ ] Named Security + Privacy Officers
- [ ] Incident response plan tested
- [ ] Sanctions policy enforced
- [ ] Periodic access reviews (quarterly)
- [ ] BAA inventory maintained

## Common Pitfalls

- ❌ **Treating HIPAA as security-only** — Privacy Rule is separate
- ❌ **Using non-BAA cloud services** — instant breach
- ❌ **PHI in test data** — entire test infra becomes PHI
- ❌ **No DR/backup** — required by Security Rule
- ❌ **Encryption as "addressable"** — effectively required, defensible only with documented alternative
- ❌ **One-time compliance** — continuous obligation
