# Architecture Patterns

## When to use this skill

- Architecture decisions for a new system
- Choosing communication patterns between services
- Splitting a monolith into modules or microservices
- Designing event-driven systems
- Implementing Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS), Event Sourcing or Saga
- Reviewing existing architecture
- Making decisions big enough for an Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

---

## High-Level Architecture Choice

### Decision tree

```
How many engineers? Team count? Domain complexity?
│
├─ <10 engineers, 1 team
│  └─ ✅ Monolith (modular monolith)
│
├─ 10-50 engineers, 2-5 teams
│  └─ ✅ Modular monolith OR few services
│
├─ 50+ engineers, 5+ teams
│  └─ Consider microservices (only if needed)
│
└─ Any size + spiky/event-driven workload
   └─ Add serverless for that piece
```

## Patterns 1–3, communication and cross-cutting decisions

Details are in [references/core-patterns.md](references/core-patterns.md). Load it after the decision tree picks a direction:

- Pattern 1: Modular Monolith (the default) · Pattern 2: Microservices · Pattern 3: Serverless / Functions
- Communication: synchronous vs asynchronous (event-driven), and when to choose which
- Cross-cutting: database per service vs shared DB · caching tiers · idempotency · decision matrix template

## Patterns 4–8: CQRS, Event Sourcing, Saga, API Gateway, Strangler Fig

Details for each are in [references/advanced-patterns.md](references/advanced-patterns.md). Load that file when the decision involves one of these:

- Pattern 4: CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
- Pattern 5: Event Sourcing
- Pattern 6: Saga (Distributed Transactions)
- Pattern 7: API Gateway
- Pattern 8: Strangler Fig (Migration)

## Anti-patterns

- ❌ **Microservices too early** — start with a monolith
- ❌ **Distributed monolith** — services that must deploy together
- ❌ **God service** — one service that does everything
- ❌ **Chatty interfaces** — one request fans out into many service calls (N+1)
- ❌ **Shared database across microservices** — all the coupling, none of the isolation
- ❌ **Synchronous calls in critical path** — cascading failures
- ❌ **No bulkheads** (no limits that isolate one service's resources) — one slow service drags everything down
- ❌ **Resume-driven architecture** — using K8s/microservices to look fancy

## Quick Reference: When to Use What

| Need | Pattern |
|------|---------|
| Small team, fast iteration | Modular monolith |
| Independent team deploys | Microservices |
| Spiky background jobs | Serverless |
| High write throughput, complex reads | CQRS |
| Full audit trail, view state at any past time | Event Sourcing |
| Multi-service transaction | Saga |
| Reduce service-to-service complexity | Service mesh |
| Multiple external clients | API Gateway |
| Migrate legacy system | Strangler Fig |

## Always Reference

When you make a decision, record it with the **adr-writer** skill. Architecture decisions are trade-offs. Future you, or whoever replaces you, needs to know why.
