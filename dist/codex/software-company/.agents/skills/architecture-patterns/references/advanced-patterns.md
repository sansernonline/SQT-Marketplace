## Pattern 4: CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

**Use one model for writes and a separate model for reads.**

```
Commands ──► Write Model ──► Event Store
                              │
                              ▼
                          Projector
                              │
                              ▼
Queries ◄── Read Models (denormalized for query)
```

**When to use:**
- ✅ Read load and write load are very different
- ✅ Complex reporting / dashboards
- ✅ Multiple read views from same data

**When NOT to use:**
- ❌ Simple create/read/update/delete (CRUD) apps (far too much)
- ❌ Reads must always show the latest write

---

## Pattern 5: Event Sourcing

**Store every change as an event, not just the current state.**

```
Instead of:           Store:
Account                Events:
  balance: $100        ├─ AccountOpened
                       ├─ Deposit($50)
                       ├─ Deposit($75)
                       └─ Withdraw($25)

State is computed from events
```

**When to use:**
- ✅ Strong audit/compliance requirements
- ✅ Need to replay history
- ✅ Questions about the past ("balance at date X")
- ✅ Complex business logic with many state transitions

**When NOT to use:**
- ❌ Apps with simple state (too much)
- ❌ No team experience with it
- ❌ Don't need history/audit
- ❌ You must be able to delete data, e.g. under GDPR (events are hard to delete)

> ⚠️ **CQRS and Event Sourcing both add a lot of complexity. Use them only where they pay off.**

## Pattern 6: Saga (Distributed Transactions)

**When several services must all succeed or all roll back.**

### Orchestration (centralized)
```
Orchestrator
   │
   ├──► Service A (do step 1)
   │    [if fail → Orchestrator triggers compensations]
   ├──► Service B (do step 2)
   └──► Service C (do step 3)
```

### Choreography (decentralized)
```
Service A ──Event──► Service B ──Event──► Service C
   ▲                                            │
   └──────────── Compensation Event ────────────┘
```

| | Orchestration | Choreography |
|---|--------------|--------------|
| Visibility | 🟢 Central | 🔴 Distributed |
| Coupling | 🟡 Coupled to orchestrator | 🟢 Loosely coupled |
| Debugging | 🟢 Easier | 🔴 Hard |
| Adding services | 🟡 Update orchestrator | 🟢 Add subscriber |

**Choose orchestration** when: complex flow, need clear visibility
**Choose choreography** when: simple flow, many independent teams

## Pattern 7: API Gateway

```
Clients ──► API Gateway ──► Multiple Services
              │
              ├─ Routing
              ├─ Auth
              ├─ Rate limit
              ├─ Logging
              └─ Aggregation
```

**Tools:** Kong, AWS API Gateway, Envoy, Tyk, NGINX

**Use when:** external clients call many services, and you want auth, rate limits and logging in one place

---

## Pattern 8: Strangler Fig (Migration)

**Move off a monolith step by step.**

```
Phase 1:    Phase 2:           Phase 3:
[Monolith]  [Mono] [NewSvc]    [NewSvc1] [NewSvc2]
                ▲    │              ▲
                └────┘ Proxy routes  └── Old Monolith deprecated
                  selective traffic
```

**Steps:**
1. Pick one business area (bounded context) to pull out
2. Build new service for that context
3. Add a proxy or feature flag that routes part of the traffic
4. Gradually shift traffic to new service
5. Delete old code when fully migrated

> 💡 **Safer than rewriting everything at once.**
