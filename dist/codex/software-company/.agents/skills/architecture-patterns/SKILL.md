# Architecture Patterns

## When to use this skill

- Architecture decisions for a new system
- Choosing communication patterns between services
- Splitting a monolith into modules or microservices
- Designing event-driven systems
- Implementing Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS), Event Sourcing or Saga
- Reviewing existing architecture
- Making decisions big enough for an Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

---

## High-Level Architecture Choice

### Decision tree

```
How many engineers? Team count? Domain complexity?
│
├─ <10 engineers, 1 team
│  └─ ✅ Monolith (modular monolith)
│
├─ 10-50 engineers, 2-5 teams
│  └─ ✅ Modular monolith OR few services
│
├─ 50+ engineers, 5+ teams
│  └─ Consider microservices (only if needed)
│
└─ Any size + spiky/event-driven workload
   └─ Add serverless for that piece
```

---

## Pattern 1: Modular Monolith

**The 2026 default for most teams.** One deployable app, split into modules with strict boundaries.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│   Single deployable application     │
│ ┌───────┐ ┌───────┐ ┌───────────┐  │
│ │Module │ │Module │ │  Module   │  │
│ │  A    │ │  B    │ │     C     │  │
│ └───────┘ └───────┘ └───────────┘  │
│   ▲           ▲           ▲         │
│   └── Strict module boundaries ──┘  │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
         │
         ▼
    Single DB (or per-module schemas)
```

**When to use:**
- ✅ Small/medium team (< 30 engineers)
- ✅ You need to ship changes fast
- ✅ Operations needs are simple
- ✅ All parts can deploy together

**When NOT to use:**
- ❌ Multiple teams needing independent deploys
- ❌ Features need very different scaling
- ❌ Parts need different tech stacks

**Implementation tips:**
- Enforce module boundaries (e.g., NestJS modules, Java packages, Go internal/)
- Each module exposes a public interface
- Don't let one module read another module's tables
- One DB, with a separate schema per module

---

## Pattern 2: Microservices

**When you've outgrown the monolith.**

```
┌──────┐  ┌──────┐  ┌──────┐
│ Svc A│  │ Svc B│  │ Svc C│
└──┬───┘  └──┬───┘  └──┬───┘
   │ ▲      │ ▲      │ ▲
   │ │      │ │      │ │     ← Each owns its DB
   ▼ │      ▼ │      ▼ │
  ┌──┴┐    ┌──┴┐    ┌──┴┐
  │DB │    │DB │    │DB │
  └───┘    └───┘    └───┘
```

**When to use:**
- ✅ Independent teams (Conway's Law)
- ✅ Different scaling needs per service
- ✅ Services need different languages or stacks
- ✅ Mature continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) and monitoring already in place

**When NOT to use (most projects):**
- ❌ Small team — the extra overhead slows everyone down
- ❌ No Kubernetes (K8s) or infrastructure-as-code (IaC) skills on the team
- ❌ Can't afford distributed tracing
- ❌ Business areas don't have clear boundaries yet

**Hidden costs:**
- 💸 Much harder to operate (about 5x the ops effort)
- 💸 Network latency between services
- 💸 Transactions across services are hard
- 💸 Bugs are harder to trace
- 💸 You need a service mesh and a monitoring stack

> 🚨 **Microservices are an organizational scaling pattern**, not a tech pattern. Adopt them only when teams blocking each other is the real bottleneck.

## Pattern 3: Serverless / Functions

**For spiky, event-driven workloads.**

```
Event ──► Function ──► Service / DB / Queue
```

**Good fits:**
- ✅ Async background processing
- ✅ Scheduled tasks (cron)
- ✅ Glue code between services
- ✅ Spiky / unpredictable traffic
- ✅ Image/video processing pipelines

**Bad fits:**
- ❌ Long-running processes (the limit is usually 15 min)
- ❌ Processing that must keep state between calls
- ❌ Frequent calls that need a fast response (cold starts add delay)
- ❌ Heavy traffic all day (the bill climbs fast)

## Communication Patterns

### Synchronous (Request-Response)

```
Client ──HTTP/gRPC──► Server
       ◄──Response───
```

| Protocol | When |
|----------|------|
| REST | Public APIs, simple CRUD |
| GraphQL | Mobile clients, multiple read patterns |
| gRPC | Internal service-to-service |
| WebSocket | Real-time bidirectional |

**Pros:** Easy to reason about and debug
**Cons:** Services depend on each other directly, one failure spreads to the next, hard to scale each part on its own

### Asynchronous (Event-Driven)

```
Producer ──► Topic/Queue ──► Consumer(s)
         (publish)         (subscribe)
```

| Tech | When |
|------|------|
| Kafka | High throughput, event sourcing, replay needed |
| RabbitMQ | Traditional queuing, work distribution |
| SQS/SNS | AWS-native, simpler than Kafka |
| NATS | Lightweight, low-latency |
| Redis Pub/Sub | Simple, messages are not stored |

**Pros:** Services don't depend on each other directly, survive failures better, scale more easily
**Cons:** Data is consistent only after a delay (eventual consistency), harder to debug, message order is hard to guarantee

### When to choose which

```
Need immediate response? ─Yes─► Sync
                         └─No──► Async

Is producer impacted by consumer? ─Yes─► Sync
                                  └─No──► Async

Multiple consumers? ─Yes─► Async (pub/sub)
                   └─No──► Either
```

## Patterns 4–8: CQRS, Event Sourcing, Saga, API Gateway, Strangler Fig

Details for each are in [references/advanced-patterns.md](references/advanced-patterns.md). Load that file when the decision involves one of these:

- Pattern 4: CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
- Pattern 5: Event Sourcing
- Pattern 6: Saga (Distributed Transactions)
- Pattern 7: API Gateway
- Pattern 8: Strangler Fig (Migration)

## Cross-Cutting Decisions

### Database per service vs Shared DB

| | Shared DB | DB per service |
|---|-----------|----------------|
| Coupling | 🔴 High | 🟢 Low |
| Consistency | 🟢 ACID (all-or-nothing transactions) | 🟡 Eventual |
| Schema changes | 🔴 Coordinate | 🟢 Independent |
| Performance | 🟢 Easy joins | 🔴 Network calls |
| Use when | Monolith | Microservices |

### Caching tiers

```
Browser cache ──► CDN ──► Reverse Proxy ──► App Cache (Redis) ──► DB
       1                  2                       3                4
       ▲                                                           ▲
       Closest to user (fastest)              Furthest (last resort)
```

Each tier is roughly 10x faster than the next. CDN = content delivery network.

### Idempotency

**Always design APIs so a repeated request does no extra harm:**
```
Client retries → Server detects duplicate → Same result, no side effect
```

Methods:
- Idempotency key header (Stripe pattern)
- A time window in which the server drops duplicates
- Methods that are safe to repeat by nature (PUT, unlike POST)

## Decision Matrix Template

When proposing architecture, compare options:

```markdown
| Factor | Weight | Option A | Option B | Option C |
|--------|:------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|
| Performance | 30% | 8 | 9 | 7 |
| Cost | 20% | 9 | 6 | 8 |
| Team skill | 20% | 9 | 5 | 7 |
| Operations | 15% | 8 | 5 | 7 |
| Future-proof | 15% | 6 | 9 | 7 |
| **Total** | 100% | **7.95** | 7.10 | 7.20 |
```

## Anti-patterns

- ❌ **Microservices too early** — start with a monolith
- ❌ **Distributed monolith** — services that must deploy together
- ❌ **God service** — one service that does everything
- ❌ **Chatty interfaces** — one request fans out into many service calls (N+1)
- ❌ **Shared database across microservices** — all the coupling, none of the isolation
- ❌ **Synchronous calls in critical path** — cascading failures
- ❌ **No bulkheads** (no limits that isolate one service's resources) — one slow service drags everything down
- ❌ **Resume-driven architecture** — using K8s/microservices to look fancy

## Always Reference

When you make a decision, record it with the **adr-writer** skill. Architecture decisions are trade-offs. Future you, or whoever replaces you, needs to know why.
