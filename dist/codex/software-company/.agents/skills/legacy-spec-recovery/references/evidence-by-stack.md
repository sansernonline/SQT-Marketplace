# Where evidence lives, by stack

Ignore build output everywhere: `bin/`, `obj/`, `publish*/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `node_modules/`, `packages/`, `vendor/`, minified `*.min.js`, and third-party plugin folders. They duplicate source and can triple every count.

## ASP.NET MVC / Web API (.NET Framework)

| Look at | For |
|---|---|
| `Controllers/*.cs` — each public method returning `ActionResult` / `JsonResult` | Screen and endpoint list; `[Authorize(Roles=...)]` and custom filters for permissions |
| `Models/*Context.cs`, `*Repository.cs`, any `SqlCommand` / `ExecuteReader` / Dapper call | Inline SQL and stored procedure names — the real rules |
| `Views/<Controller>/*.cshtml` | Screen title, field labels, client validation, which actions the form posts to |
| `Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml`, menu partials | Which screens are reachable, and by which role |
| `Web.config` — `connectionStrings`, `appSettings`, `system.serviceModel` | Databases, integrations (SAP RFC, SOAP, mail), switches. Names only, never values |
| `App_Start/RouteConfig.cs`, `FilterConfig.cs`, `Startup.Auth.cs` | Routing quirks, global filters, login method |
| `*.asmx`, `*.svc` | SOAP services other systems call into |
| `*.rpt` (Crystal Reports) | Formulas and record selection hidden inside the binary; list them, ask for an export if needed |

## SQL Server

| Look at | For |
|---|---|
| Schema scripts, `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS` exports | Data dictionary |
| Stored procedures, views, functions, triggers | Rules that run regardless of which application writes |
| SSIS packages (`.dtsx`) | Imports, exports, schedules, transformations — open as XML, search `SqlCommand` and connection names |
| SQL Agent jobs | When batch rules run |

## Other common stacks

| Stack | First places to look |
|---|---|
| Classic ASP / Web Forms | `.aspx` + code-behind, `Page_Load`, `Button_Click`, `include` files |
| PHP | Entry scripts, `include`/`require` chains, raw `mysqli_query` strings |
| Java EE / Spring | `@Controller`/`@RequestMapping`, `*Mapper.xml` (MyBatis), `persistence.xml`, `@Scheduled` |
| VB6 / Access / Delphi | Forms, modules, embedded queries — often only the database is readable; start there |
| COBOL / RPG | Copybooks for record layouts, JCL for job flow |
| Node / JavaScript SPA | Router config, API client module, form schemas, `.env.example` |
| Mobile (Xamarin, native) | API base URL and endpoint list, offline storage schema |
