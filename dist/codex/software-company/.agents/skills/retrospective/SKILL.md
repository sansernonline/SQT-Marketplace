> retro นี้เป็นของ**ทีมคน** — ผลคือเอกสาร retro และ action items เท่านั้น **ไม่แก้ skill · agent · playbook** · ถ้าอยากให้บทเรียนเข้า skill ของทีม agent ผู้ใช้ต้องสั่ง "รวมบทเรียน" แยกเอง (playbook `learn-from-session` ของ `superuser`)

Use the `project-manager` agent to facilitate a retrospective for: **สิ่งที่ผู้ใช้ระบุมากับคำสั่ง**

The PM should run this structured retro:

## 1. Set the Stage
Ask the user once, at the start, all of the following (sprint facts and the retro input in step 2); do not stop to ask again. Anything the user doesn't know → write `(รอยืนยัน)` and keep going:
- What was the sprint goal?
- Was it achieved? (yes/partial/no)
- Any major events during sprint?
- What went well — what should we keep doing?
- What didn't go well — what should we stop doing?
- Any ideas to try next sprint, or puzzles we don't understand yet?

## 2. Gather Data (Start/Stop/Continue + Mad/Sad/Glad)

Using the answers from the start question, organize into:

### Went Well (Glad)
What should we **continue** doing?
- ...

### Didn't Go Well (Sad/Mad)
What should we **stop** doing?
- ...

### Ideas to Try
What should we **start** doing?
- ...

### Puzzles
Things we don't yet understand:
- ...

## 3. Generate Insights

For each major theme:
- Why did this happen?
- What's the systemic cause?
- Is this a one-time issue or pattern?

## 4. Decide on Actions

Produce **3-5 concrete action items** (not 20 — focus matters):

| Action | Owner | Due | Success Metric |
|--------|-------|-----|----------------|
| ...    | ...   | ... | ...            |

Rules:
- Each action has ONE owner (not "the team")
- Each action has a due date
- Each action has a way to measure if it worked
- If you can't measure it, it's not a real action

## 5. Close

- Summarize key takeaways (2-3 lines)
- Acknowledge team wins
- Confirm next retro date

## Output Format
