# Code Review Checklist

## When to use this skill

- Reviewing a pull request
- Self-review before submitting code
- Onboarding new code reviewers
- Auditing code quality of existing modules

## When NOT to use

| Task | Use instead |
|---|---|
| Second look at a finished piece inside a team | a new `reviewer` agent (it applies this checklist to code) |
| Contested design, large or high-risk diff, "stress test" / "find blind spots" | `adversarial-review-panel` (several `reviewer` agents) |
| Reviewing a visual (image, poster, screen look) | (if plugin `graphic-design` is installed) `graphic-design:design-review`, else `ui-craft` checks |
| Writing or updating the PR description itself | `pr-description-template` |
| Hunting misleading patterns across the codebase, not one diff | `code-gardener` |
| Scanners, secrets or dependency check before ship or after adding a dependency | `security-gate` (run both before merge) |
| Web app or API that must meet OWASP Top 10:2025 | `owasp-top10` (per-stack checks in its `references/stack-checks.md`) |

## Review Process

1. **Understand the intent** — read PR description and linked ticket
2. **Skim the diff** — get overall sense of changes
3. **Deep review** — go through each section of checklist below
4. **Run the code** if non-trivial — don't just read
5. **Leave actionable comments** — suggest fixes, not just point out problems

## Checklist

House checks first. Each skill holds the full rules, so link to it in the comment:

- [ ] Security: run [`security-gate`](../security-gate/SKILL.md) on the diff (input checked at the boundary, parameterized SQL, server-side permission check, no secrets in code or logs)
- [ ] Simple enough: [`lazy-coding`](../lazy-coding/SKILL.md) (no unused layers, standard library first, one concern per file)
- [ ] Readable: [`readable-code`](../readable-code/SKILL.md) (names, file and folder layout, config outside code)
- [ ] Tests sit next to the code and prove the change: [`testing-standards`](../testing-standards/SKILL.md)
- [ ] Shared code touched → [`blast-radius`](../blast-radius/SKILL.md) list is in the PR
- [ ] Commit message follows [`commit-message-format`](../commit-message-format/SKILL.md)

The generic list (correctness, design, performance, documentation, maintainability) is in [`references/full-checklist.md`](references/full-checklist.md).

## Comment Templates

### Suggestion (non-blocking)
```
nit: Consider X for readability
```

### Question
```
q: Why did you choose X over Y here?
```

### Blocking issue
```
blocking: This will cause Y in production because Z.
Suggest: <concrete fix>
```

### Praise
```
Nice approach with X — much cleaner than the previous version.
```

## Review Severity Levels

| Prefix | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `blocking:` | Must fix before merge |
| `important:` | Should fix, can be follow-up if urgent |
| `nit:` | Minor improvement, optional |
| `q:` | Question, not necessarily a change |
| `praise:` | Acknowledge good work |

These prefixes are for comments on a pull request. A review report uses the `reviewer` scale: `blocking:` = สูง · `important:` = กลาง · `nit:` = ต่ำ, verdict ผ่าน / ไม่ผ่าน

## Anti-patterns to Avoid

As a reviewer:
- Bikeshedding — don't fight over trivial style if there's no convention
- "Why didn't you do it MY way?" — there are often multiple valid approaches
- Only criticism — acknowledge good things too
- Vague comments like "this is wrong" — explain WHY and suggest fix
- Reviewing too much at once — request smaller PRs (under 400 lines)

# Code review — full generic checklist

Moved out of [SKILL.md](../SKILL.md). Open it for a large or unfamiliar change. The house-specific checks stay in SKILL.md.

### 🎯 Correctness

- [ ] Does the code do what the PR description says?
- [ ] Are edge cases handled? (null, empty, zero, negative, very large)
- [ ] Are error paths handled? (network failure, timeout, invalid input)
- [ ] Are race conditions / concurrency issues considered?
- [ ] Off-by-one errors checked?
- [ ] Are assumptions explicit (or asserted)?

### 🏗️ Design

- [ ] Does this fit the existing architecture?
- [ ] Is the abstraction at the right level? (not too generic, not too specific)
- [ ] Single Responsibility — does each function/class do one thing?
- [ ] DRY — but not over-abstracted?
- [ ] Are dependencies appropriate? (no circular, minimal coupling)
- [ ] Could this be simpler?

### 🧪 Tests

- [ ] Are there tests for the new code?
- [ ] Tests cover happy path + edge cases + errors?
- [ ] Tests would actually fail if code broke? (no false positives)
- [ ] Tests are readable and maintainable?
- [ ] No flaky tests introduced?

### 🔒 Security

- [ ] Input validation at boundaries?
- [ ] No SQL injection (parameterized queries)?
- [ ] No XSS (proper escaping)?
- [ ] No secrets/credentials in code?
- [ ] Authorization checks for sensitive operations?
- [ ] PII / sensitive data logged appropriately?
- [ ] Dependencies updated? No known CVEs?

### 🚀 Performance

- [ ] No N+1 queries?
- [ ] Appropriate caching where beneficial?
- [ ] Loops/algorithms with appropriate complexity?
- [ ] Large data handled with pagination/streaming?
- [ ] No unnecessary network calls?

### 📖 Readability

- [ ] Names reveal intent? (variables, functions, classes)
- [ ] Functions reasonably short?
- [ ] Complex logic has explanatory comments? (WHY, not WHAT)
- [ ] No commented-out code left behind?
- [ ] No debug prints / TODO without ticket?
- [ ] Consistent with existing code style?

### 📚 Documentation

- [ ] Public APIs documented?
- [ ] README/CHANGELOG updated if needed?
- [ ] Breaking changes called out?
- [ ] New env vars / config documented?

### 🔄 Maintainability

- [ ] Could a new team member understand this in 6 months?
- [ ] Easy to modify when requirements change?
- [ ] No magic numbers / strings (use constants)?
- [ ] Logging at appropriate levels?
