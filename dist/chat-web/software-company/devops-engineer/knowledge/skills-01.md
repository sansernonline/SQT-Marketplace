# skill: lazy-coding

Use when writing, fixing, refactoring or reviewing code. Forces the simplest solution that actually works — ask whether it is needed at all, then the standard library before custom code, native features before dependencies, and one line before fifty. Lazy about how much code exists, never about where it lives — one concern per file, feature folders, clear names, the layout a software engineer expects. Also triggers on complaints about bloat or scattered code. For documents and plans use simplicity-first.

# Lazy Coding

You write code like a senior dev who has been paged at 3 AM for someone else's
clever abstraction. Lazy means efficient, not careless. The best code is the
code you never had to write.

**Team rule (JK's):** a tired teammate must understand it in 6 months, with no
context. If they can't, simplify until they can.

## Active every response

On by default at **full**. Don't drift back to over-building — still on even
when you're unsure. Switch with `lazy lite | full | ultra`. Off only on
"stop lazy" / "normal mode".

## The ladder — stop at the first rung that holds

1. **Does this need to exist?** Speculative need → skip it, say so in one line. (YAGNI)
2. **Stdlib does it?** Use it.
3. **Native platform feature covers it?** `<input type="date">` over a picker lib, CSS over JS, a DB constraint over app code.
4. **An already-installed dependency solves it?** Use it. Never add a new dependency for what a few lines can do.
5. **Can it be one line?** One line.
6. **Only then:** the smallest code that works.

Two rungs both work → take the higher one and move on. The ladder is a reflex,
not a research project. The first lazy solution that works is the right one.

## Rules

- No unrequested abstractions — no interface with one implementation, no factory for one product, no config for a value that never changes.
- No scaffolding "for later." Later can scaffold for itself.
- Delete before you add. Boring before clever — clever is what someone decodes at 3 AM.
- Shortest working diff wins — but never by merging concerns into one file. Fewest files **that still keep one concern per file**.
- Match the repo — read 2-3 nearby files first and copy their style.
- Two stdlib options the same size? Take the one that's correct on edge cases. Lazy means less code, not a flimsier algorithm.

## Simple is not scattered

Lazy cuts *how much* code exists. It never cuts *where code lives*. A 40-line
project still looks like software engineering, not a scratchpad:

- **One concern per file.** Entry point, logic, config and I/O each have their own place. A `main.py` that also parses, validates, talks to the database and prints is not lazy — it is a god-file nobody can test.
- **Feature folders, not type folders.** `invoice/` holds everything about invoices (`readable-code` §7). No `utils/` dumping ground.
- **Names carry meaning.** Lazy is not `tmp`, `data`, `handle()`. Follow `readable-code` §1–4.
- **Boundaries stay explicit.** Function signatures, module exports and the data shape between layers are written out, not implied — fewer lines inside each box, never fewer boxes.
- **Config and secrets outside code.** Even one environment variable goes in `.env.example`, not inline.
- **Tests sit next to the code they test** — one small check per non-trivial path (see "When NOT to be lazy").
- **New project → `project-bootstrap` first.** Lazy code lands in a repo that already has its skeleton (README, folder layout, lint, test command). Never scatter files at the root to save a minute.

Test: a tired teammate opens the repo cold. Can they guess which file holds a
given behaviour in 30 seconds? If not, the structure is not too complex — it
is *missing*.

## Mark your simplifications

A deliberate shortcut reads as intent, not ignorance, when you label it. Name
the ceiling and the upgrade path:

```python
# simple: in-memory dict cache — swap for Redis if we run more than one process
```

```ts
// simple: O(n) scan, fine under ~1k items — index it if the list grows
```

## Output

Code first. Then at most three short lines: what you skipped and when to add
it. If the explanation is longer than the code, delete the explanation.

Pattern: `[code] → skipped: [X] — add when [Y].`

## Intensity

| Level | What changes |
|-------|------------|
| **lite** | Build what's asked, but name the lazier option in one line. JK picks. |
| **full** | The ladder enforced. Stdlib and native first. Shortest diff, shortest explanation. Default. |
| **ultra** | YAGNI extremist. Ship the one-liner and challenge the rest of the requirement in the same breath. |

Example — "Add a cache for these API responses."

- **lite:** "Done. FYI `functools.lru_cache` does this in one line if you'd rather not own a cache class."
- **full:** "`@lru_cache(maxsize=1000)` on the fetch function. Skipped a custom cache class — add when lru_cache measurably falls short."
- **ultra:** "No cache until a profiler asks for one. When it does: `@lru_cache`. A hand-rolled TTL cache is a bug farm with a hit rate."

## When NOT to be lazy

Never simplify away: input validation at trust boundaries, error handling that
prevents data loss, security, accessibility basics, or anything explicitly
requested. If JK insists on the full version, build it — no re-arguing.

Non-trivial logic (a branch, loop, parser, or money/security path) leaves ONE
runnable check behind — the smallest thing that fails if the logic breaks: an
`assert`-based self-check or one small `test_*`. No frameworks or fixtures
unless asked. Trivial one-liners need no test.

## Pairs with

- `readable-code` — **always load together**. Lazy decides how much code; readable-code decides names, function shape and file layout. One without the other gives either bloat or a scratchpad.
- `project-bootstrap` — the repo skeleton lazy code lands in.
- `simplicity-first` — same spirit, for docs, plans, and architecture.
- `code-review-checklist` — the lazy diff still gets reviewed.

# skill: simplicity-first

Use when producing a document, design, architecture or plan — BRD, FSD, ADR, roadmap, UX or API design, sprint plan. Defaults to the simplest version that works and applies the "could a tired teammate follow this in 6 months?" test before delivery. Rejects buzzwords, premature abstraction and unnecessary layers. For code use lazy-coding instead.

# Simplicity First

> The best architecture has the fewest moving parts. The best plan is the one a
> teammate can follow with no context.

This skill covers **non-code outputs** — documents, plans, architecture, and
designs. For code, use `lazy-coding`.

## The one test

Before submitting, ask:

> Could a tired teammate understand this in 6 months, with no prior context?

If "no" or "not sure" → simplify.

## 5 principles

1. **Start with the simplest thing that works.** Add complexity only when something breaks.
2. **Reduce moving parts.** Each component adds failure modes, ops burden, and docs. Default to one thing.
3. **Use familiar patterns.** Boring, proven tech for critical paths. Save novelty for low-risk experiments.
4. **Optimize for reading.** It's read far more often than written.
5. **Delete &gt; add.** The best edit removes something. The worst adds a layer for an imagined future need.

## By output type

### Documents (BRD, FSD, ADR)

Do: short sentences (≤ 20 words), plain English, one idea per paragraph, an
example for every abstract point, tables for structured data.

Avoid: marketing-speak ("revolutionary", "best-in-class", "synergy"), undefined
jargon, walls of text, hedging ("might possibly potentially"), acronym soup.

### Architecture

Do: monolith first (split only when a bottleneck is proven), familiar stack,
standard patterns (REST, queues, caches), single source of truth per data type.

Avoid: microservices for small teams, distributed-everything, multi-master
databases before you must, event-driven by default (sync is simpler).

### Plans

Do: 3-5 priorities (not 20), a named owner per item, measurable success
criteria, realistic timelines with buffer, cut scope to fit time.

Avoid: vague goals ("improve quality"), 50-item lists (= no priority),
aspirational dates with no buffer, plans without success metrics.

### Designs (UX, API)

Do: fewest steps to the user's goal, reuse existing patterns, stay consistent
across screens, defaults that work for 80%, progressive disclosure.

Avoid: novel interactions where a standard one works, 10-step flows when 3
work, required fields with no smart default, hidden features needing tutorials.

## The 3-question filter

Before adding any new component, configuration option, or pattern:

1. Is there real evidence we need this **now** (not "might need")?
2. Is there a simpler way? (Sleep on it. Often yes.)
3. What's the cost of **not** adding it? (Often nothing, or a small refactor later.)

Two or more answers point to "simpler is fine" → don't add it.

## Examples

**API description**

❌ "This sophisticated, enterprise-grade endpoint leverages state-of-the-art
authentication to facilitate the seamless retrieval of user profile data."

✅ "`GET /users/{id}` returns a user profile. Requires a Bearer token. Use
`?fields=name,email` to limit the response."

**Sprint goal**

❌ "Improve overall product quality and customer satisfaction through various
initiatives."

✅ "Reduce login errors by 50% (8% → 4%): fix timeout bug (2d), retry on
transient errors (1d), clearer error messages (1d)."

**Architecture for a new feature**

❌ "Event-sourced microservice with CQRS, Kafka ingestion, Redis cache, and a
dedicated auth service."

✅ "Add an endpoint to the existing API. One Postgres table for state. Standard
auth middleware. Log to the existing system."

## Anti-patterns to reject

- **Future-proofing** — abstractions for needs that never arrive.
- **"It might scale"** — infra for 1M users while you have 1k.
- **Layer cake** — 6 layers where 90% just pass through.
- **Resume-driven design** — fancy tech to look sophisticated.
- **Buzzword stacking** — "cloud-native event-driven AI-powered".

## Pre-submit checklist

- [ ] A tired teammate would understand this in 6 months.
- [ ] Nothing can be deleted without losing meaning.
- [ ] No jargon the audience won't know.
- [ ] Every abstract claim has an example.
- [ ] I could explain the whole thing in two sentences.

If any answer is "no" → simplify before delivering.

# skill: postmortem-template

Use when writing a post-incident review, documenting a production outage, conducting a blameless postmortem, or analyzing how an incident was handled. Focuses on systemic issues and actionable improvements rather than blame.

# Blameless Postmortem Template

## When to use this skill

- After any incident affecting production (SEV1-SEV3)
- After a near-miss that could have been a major incident
- After significant bugs that reached production
- After a security incident

## Core Principles

1. **Blameless** — focus on systems and processes, not individuals
2. **Honest** — don't soften facts to protect feelings
3. **Actionable** — every postmortem produces concrete action items
4. **Educational** — others should learn from this

## Severity Levels

| Level | Definition | Response Time |
|-------|-----------|---------------|
| **SEV1** | Total outage, data loss, security breach | Immediate, 24/7 |
| **SEV2** | Major feature down, significant user impact | Within 1 hour |
| **SEV3** | Degraded service, partial impact | Within business hours |
| **SEV4** | Minor issue, no user impact | Next business day |

## Output Template

```markdown
# Postmortem: <Short Incident Title>

**Date of Incident:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Date of Postmortem:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Severity:** SEV1 | SEV2 | SEV3 | SEV4
**Duration:** XX hours XX minutes
**Authors:** <names>
**Status:** Draft | Final

---

## 1. Summary

<3-5 sentences for executives: what happened, impact, what we did, what we learned>

## 2. Impact

- **User-facing:** Yes | No
- **Users affected:** ~XX,XXX (X%)
- **Duration:** XX min
- **Revenue impact:** $XXX (if known)
- **Data loss:** None | Minor | Significant
- **SLA breached:** Yes | No
- **Regulatory implications:** None | <describe>

## 3. Timeline

All times in UTC.

| Time | Event |
|------|-------|
| HH:MM | First customer complaint |
| HH:MM | On-call paged by alert |
| HH:MM | Investigation started |
| HH:MM | Root cause identified |
| HH:MM | Mitigation deployed |
| HH:MM | Service restored |
| HH:MM | All clear confirmed |

## 4. What Happened (Detailed)

### Detection
How was the incident detected? Was it automated alerting or customer report?
- Time to detect (TTD): XX minutes
- Could we have detected faster? How?

### Investigation
What did we look at? What did we rule out?
- Tools used: ...
- Wrong turns / red herrings: ...

### Mitigation
What stopped the bleeding? (Not necessarily the fix)
- Time to mitigate (TTM): XX minutes

### Resolution
What was the permanent fix?
- Time to resolve (TTR): XX minutes

## 5. Root Cause Analysis

Use **5 Whys** technique:

- Why did the service go down? → Database queries timed out
- Why did queries time out? → Connection pool exhausted
- Why was the pool exhausted? → A new endpoint didn't release connections
- Why didn't it release connections? → Missing `finally` block
- Why wasn't this caught? → No load tests for that endpoint

**Root cause:** <one-sentence statement>

**Contributing factors:**
- ...
- ...

## 6. What Went Well

- Monitoring alerted within X minutes
- Rollback completed quickly thanks to ...
- Team collaboration on Slack was effective
- ...

## 7. What Went Wrong

- Took X minutes longer than needed because ...
- Runbook was outdated
- Required engineer was offline; no backup
- ...

## 8. Where We Got Lucky

- Issue happened during business hours; would have been worse at night
- Customer X didn't notice because they were also having maintenance
- ...

## 9. Action Items

| # | Action | Owner | Type | Priority | Due Date |
|---|--------|-------|------|----------|----------|
| 1 | Add monitoring for X | @alice | Prevent | P1 | YYYY-MM-DD |
| 2 | Update runbook | @bob | Mitigate | P2 | YYYY-MM-DD |
| 3 | Add load test for endpoint | @charlie | Prevent | P1 | YYYY-MM-DD |

**Action types:**
- **Prevent:** stops this from happening again
- **Detect:** catches it sooner if it happens
- **Mitigate:** reduces impact when it happens
- **Process:** improves how we respond

## 10. Lessons Learned

What can other teams learn from this?
- Lesson 1: ...
- Lesson 2: ...

## 11. Supporting Information

- Incident channel: #inc-XXX
- Status page updates: <link>
- Customer communications: <link>
- Graphs / dashboards: <link>
- Related PRs: <links>
```

## Blameless Language Guide

| ❌ Blameful | ✅ Blameless |
|------------|--------------|
| "Alice deployed the bug" | "A bug was deployed in PR #123" |
| "Bob should have caught this in review" | "The review process didn't catch this; we should add automated checks" |
| "QA missed this case" | "Our test coverage didn't include this scenario" |
| "Someone forgot to..." | "The process doesn't ensure that..." |
| "Human error" | "The system allowed the mistake to happen" |

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Timeline includes specific times (not vague "morning of")
- [ ] Root cause goes deep enough (not just "bug in code")
- [ ] Action items have owners AND due dates
- [ ] Action items are tracked in actual ticket system
- [ ] Blameless language throughout
- [ ] Reviewed by someone NOT involved in incident
- [ ] Shared with broader team for learning

## Common Mistakes

- ❌ "Lessons learned: be more careful" — not actionable
- ❌ Single root cause when there are usually multiple factors
- ❌ Action items without owners → never done
- ❌ Skipping postmortem because "minor" — near-misses teach us most
- ❌ Hiding postmortems — share widely for org learning
- ❌ Blame language even when "talking about systems"

## When to Skip Postmortem

Almost never. Even for SEV4, a short writeup helps. Always do one for:
- Any SEV1 / SEV2
- Repeated SEV3+ from same root cause
- Security incidents
- Customer-facing incidents
- Data integrity issues

## Document Look

This skill decides **what goes in** the document. It does not decide **how it looks** —
load the matching skill before writing, not after:

| What is being handed over | Load |
|---|---|
| Markdown someone reads (repo, wiki, issue tracker) | `polished-document-style` |
| A rendered `.docx` / `.pptx` / PDF a stakeholder signs off on | `branded-document-design` |
| The point needs a picture to land | `markdown-visuals`, then `software-diagrams` |

Default formatting is not neutral — it reads as unfinished work.
