# Blameless Postmortem Template

> **ภาษา:** ถ้อยคำทุกบรรทัดเขียนตาม [`human-writing`](../human-writing/SKILL.md) — skill นี้บอกรูปแบบและโครง ส่วน human-writing บอกวิธีเขียนให้คนอ่านรู้เรื่อง

## When to use this skill

- After any incident affecting production (SEV1-SEV3)
- After a near-miss that could have been a major incident
- After significant bugs that reached production
- After a security incident

## Core Principles

1. **Blameless** — focus on systems and processes, not individuals
2. **Honest** — don't soften facts to protect feelings
3. **Actionable** — every postmortem produces concrete action items
4. **Educational** — others should learn from this

## Severity Levels

| Level | Definition | Response Time |
|-------|-----------|---------------|
| **SEV1** | Total outage, data loss, security breach | Immediate, 24/7 |
| **SEV2** | Major feature down, significant user impact | Within 1 hour |
| **SEV3** | Degraded service, partial impact | Within business hours |
| **SEV4** | Minor issue, no user impact | Next business day |

## Output Template

```markdown
# Postmortem: <Short Incident Title>

**Date of Incident:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Date of Postmortem:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Severity:** SEV1 | SEV2 | SEV3 | SEV4
**Duration:** XX hours XX minutes
**Authors:** <names>
**Status:** Draft | Final

---

## 1. Summary

<3-5 sentences for executives: what happened, impact, what we did, what we learned>

## 2. Impact

- **User-facing:** Yes | No
- **Users affected:** ~XX,XXX (X%)
- **Duration:** XX min
- **Revenue impact:** $XXX (if known)
- **Data loss:** None | Minor | Significant
- **SLA breached:** Yes | No
- **Regulatory implications:** None | <describe>

## 3. Timeline

All times in UTC.

| Time | Event |
|------|-------|
| HH:MM | First customer complaint |
| HH:MM | On-call paged by alert |
| HH:MM | Investigation started |
| HH:MM | Root cause identified |
| HH:MM | Mitigation deployed |
| HH:MM | Service restored |
| HH:MM | All clear confirmed |

## 4. What Happened (Detailed)

### Detection
How was the incident detected? Was it automated alerting or customer report?
- Time to detect (TTD): XX minutes
- Could we have detected faster? How?

### Investigation
What did we look at? What did we rule out?
- Tools used: ...
- Wrong turns / red herrings: ...

### Mitigation
What stopped the bleeding? (Not necessarily the fix)
- Time to mitigate (TTM): XX minutes

### Resolution
What was the permanent fix?
- Time to resolve (TTR): XX minutes

## 5. Root Cause Analysis

Use **5 Whys** technique:

- Why did the service go down? → Database queries timed out
- Why did queries time out? → Connection pool exhausted
- Why was the pool exhausted? → A new endpoint didn't release connections
- Why didn't it release connections? → Missing `finally` block
- Why wasn't this caught? → No load tests for that endpoint

**Root cause:** <one-sentence statement>

**Contributing factors:**
- ...
- ...

## 6. What Went Well

- Monitoring alerted within X minutes
- Rollback completed quickly thanks to ...
- Team collaboration on Slack was effective
- ...

## 7. What Went Wrong

- Took X minutes longer than needed because ...
- Runbook was outdated
- Required engineer was offline; no backup
- ...

## 8. Where We Got Lucky

- Issue happened during business hours; would have been worse at night
- Customer X didn't notice because they were also having maintenance
- ...

## 9. Action Items

| # | Action | Owner | Type | Priority | Due Date |
|---|--------|-------|------|----------|----------|
| 1 | Add monitoring for X | @alice | Prevent | P1 | YYYY-MM-DD |
| 2 | Update runbook | @bob | Mitigate | P2 | YYYY-MM-DD |
| 3 | Add load test for endpoint | @charlie | Prevent | P1 | YYYY-MM-DD |

**Action types:**
- **Prevent:** stops this from happening again
- **Detect:** catches it sooner if it happens
- **Mitigate:** reduces impact when it happens
- **Process:** improves how we respond

## 10. Lessons Learned

What can other teams learn from this?
- Lesson 1: ...
- Lesson 2: ...

## 11. Supporting Information

- Incident channel: #inc-XXX
- Status page updates: <link>
- Customer communications: <link>
- Graphs / dashboards: <link>
- Related PRs: <links>
```

## Blameless Language Guide

| ❌ Blameful | ✅ Blameless |
|------------|--------------|
| "Alice deployed the bug" | "A bug was deployed in PR #123" |
| "Bob should have caught this in review" | "The review process didn't catch this; we should add automated checks" |
| "QA missed this case" | "Our test coverage didn't include this scenario" |
| "Someone forgot to..." | "The process doesn't ensure that..." |
| "Human error" | "The system allowed the mistake to happen" |

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Timeline includes specific times (not vague "morning of")
- [ ] Root cause goes deep enough (not just "bug in code")
- [ ] Action items have owners AND due dates
- [ ] Action items are tracked in actual ticket system
- [ ] Blameless language throughout
- [ ] Reviewed by someone NOT involved in incident
- [ ] Shared with broader team for learning

## Common Mistakes

- ❌ "Lessons learned: be more careful" — not actionable
- ❌ Single root cause when there are usually multiple factors
- ❌ Action items without owners → never done
- ❌ Skipping postmortem because "minor" — near-misses teach us most
- ❌ Hiding postmortems — share widely for org learning
- ❌ Blame language even when "talking about systems"

## When to Skip Postmortem

Almost never. Even for SEV4, a short writeup helps. Always do one for:
- Any SEV1 / SEV2
- Repeated SEV3+ from same root cause
- Security incidents
- Customer-facing incidents
- Data integrity issues

## Document Look

This skill decides **what goes in** the document. It does not decide **how it looks** —
load the matching skill before writing, not after:

| What is being handed over | Load |
|---|---|
| Markdown someone reads (repo, wiki, issue tracker) | `polished-document-style` |
| A rendered `.docx` / `.pptx` / PDF a stakeholder signs off on | `branded-document-design` |
| The point needs a picture to land | `markdown-visuals`, then `software-diagrams` |

Default formatting is not neutral — it reads as unfinished work.

# skill: code-review-checklist

Use when reviewing a pull request, self-reviewing before submitting, or auditing code quality. Correctness, design, security, testing, maintainability.

> **ใน SuperUser:** รีวิวเริ่มจาก playbook [`review`](../superuser/references/playbook-review.md) แล้วใช้ checklist นี้กับรีวิวทั่วไป ส่วนงานเสี่ยงสูงหรือ diff ใหญ่ใช้ [`adversarial-review-panel`](../adversarial-review-panel/SKILL.md)

# Code Review Checklist

## When to use this skill

- Reviewing a pull request
- Self-review before submitting code
- Onboarding new code reviewers
- Auditing code quality of existing modules

## Review Process

1. **Understand the intent** — read PR description and linked ticket
2. **Skim the diff** — get overall sense of changes
3. **Deep review** — go through each section of checklist below
4. **Run the code** if non-trivial — don't just read
5. **Leave actionable comments** — suggest fixes, not just point out problems

## Checklist

### 🎯 Correctness

- [ ] Does the code do what the PR description says?
- [ ] Are edge cases handled? (null, empty, zero, negative, very large)
- [ ] Are error paths handled? (network failure, timeout, invalid input)
- [ ] Are race conditions / concurrency issues considered?
- [ ] Off-by-one errors checked?
- [ ] Are assumptions explicit (or asserted)?

### 🏗️ Design

- [ ] Does this fit the existing architecture?
- [ ] Is the abstraction at the right level? (not too generic, not too specific)
- [ ] Single Responsibility — does each function/class do one thing?
- [ ] DRY — but not over-abstracted?
- [ ] Are dependencies appropriate? (no circular, minimal coupling)
- [ ] Could this be simpler?

### 🧪 Tests

- [ ] Are there tests for the new code?
- [ ] Tests cover happy path + edge cases + errors?
- [ ] Tests would actually fail if code broke? (no false positives)
- [ ] Tests are readable and maintainable?
- [ ] No flaky tests introduced?

### 🔒 Security

- [ ] Input validation at boundaries?
- [ ] No SQL injection (parameterized queries)?
- [ ] No XSS (proper escaping)?
- [ ] No secrets/credentials in code?
- [ ] Authorization checks for sensitive operations?
- [ ] PII / sensitive data logged appropriately?
- [ ] Dependencies updated? No known CVEs?

### 🚀 Performance

- [ ] No N+1 queries?
- [ ] Appropriate caching where beneficial?
- [ ] Loops/algorithms with appropriate complexity?
- [ ] Large data handled with pagination/streaming?
- [ ] No unnecessary network calls?

### 📖 Readability

- [ ] Names reveal intent? (variables, functions, classes)
- [ ] Functions reasonably short?
- [ ] Complex logic has explanatory comments? (WHY, not WHAT)
- [ ] No commented-out code left behind?
- [ ] No debug prints / TODO without ticket?
- [ ] Consistent with existing code style?

### 📚 Documentation

- [ ] Public APIs documented?
- [ ] README/CHANGELOG updated if needed?
- [ ] Breaking changes called out?
- [ ] New env vars / config documented?

### 🔄 Maintainability

- [ ] Could a new team member understand this in 6 months?
- [ ] Easy to modify when requirements change?
- [ ] No magic numbers / strings (use constants)?
- [ ] Logging at appropriate levels?

## Comment Templates

### Suggestion (non-blocking)
```
nit: Consider X for readability
```

### Question
```
q: Why did you choose X over Y here?
```

### Blocking issue
```
blocking: This will cause Y in production because Z.
Suggest: <concrete fix>
```

### Praise
```
✨ Nice approach with X — much cleaner than the previous version.
```

## Review Severity Levels

| Prefix | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `blocking:` | Must fix before merge |
| `important:` | Should fix, can be follow-up if urgent |
| `nit:` | Minor improvement, optional |
| `q:` | Question, not necessarily a change |
| `praise:` | Acknowledge good work |

## Anti-patterns to Avoid

As a reviewer:
- ❌ Bikeshedding — don't fight over trivial style if there's no convention
- ❌ "Why didn't you do it MY way?" — there are often multiple valid approaches
- ❌ Only criticism — acknowledge good things too
- ❌ Vague comments like "this is wrong" — explain WHY and suggest fix
- ❌ Reviewing too much at once — request smaller PRs (under 400 lines)

# skill: markdown-visuals

Use when a markdown doc needs a picture (wireframe, UI state, flow, architecture). Picks inline SVG, image, ASCII or Mermaid so it renders everywhere.

# Markdown Visuals

> **ภาษา:** ถ้อยคำทุกบรรทัดเขียนตาม [`human-writing`](../human-writing/SKILL.md) — skill นี้บอกรูปแบบและโครง ส่วน human-writing บอกวิธีเขียนให้คนอ่านรู้เรื่อง

> **Scope:** this skill decides *how a picture goes into a markdown file* (inline SVG · image file · ASCII · Mermaid) and how to embed it. What a diagram should show lives in `software-diagrams` (Mermaid in the house theme) and `diagram-figures` (designed figures). Document formatting around the picture lives in `polished-document-style`.

> **Rule:** Every design, mockup, spec, or architecture doc must show — not just tell. If you wrote "the button sits top-right," you owe the reader a picture.

## When to use this skill

- Producing **any** design mockup, wireframe, or UI spec
- Writing FSD, BRD, ADR, or architecture docs that describe layout, flow, or relationships
- Explaining state transitions, user journeys, or system interactions
- Comparing 2+ visual options for the user
- The user said "make a mockup," "show me how it looks," or "design X"

**If the doc has zero visuals and is about anything visual or structural — stop and add one.**

## Decision tree: which format?

```
What are you showing?
│
├─ UI mockup / component state / icon       →  Inline SVG
├─ Layout sketch / box diagram / state map  →  ASCII art (boxes & arrows)
├─ Flow / sequence / decision tree          →  Mermaid (software-diagrams)
├─ Architecture / ER / class                →  Mermaid (software-diagrams)
├─ Designed figure (proposal, slide, print) →  diagram-figures → embed the PNG as an image file (§2)
├─ Data viz (chart, pie, quadrant)          →  Mermaid pie/quadrant OR inline SVG
├─ Photo, screenshot, complex illustration  →  External file → ![alt](assets/x.png)
└─ Quick concept in chat reply              →  Inline SVG or ASCII (no external file)
```

**Default to inline SVG**, except for flows and sequences (use Mermaid for those). Inline SVG renders everywhere and versions cleanly in git. It adds no binary files to the repo, and the user can read and edit the markup.

## 1 · Inline SVG (primary technique)

### Boilerplate

```markdown
<p align="center">
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 640 280" role="img" aria-label="<what this shows>">
  <!-- background -->
  <rect width="640" height="280" rx="14" fill="#1c2230"/>

  <!-- content goes here -->
</svg>
</p>
```

**Required attributes:**
- `xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"` — without this, GitHub may not render
- `viewBox` — sets the coordinate space; lets the SVG scale responsively
- `role="img"` + `aria-label` — accessibility, screen readers
- `<p align="center">` wrapper — centers in the rendered page

**Sizing:** Use `viewBox` (not width/height) so it scales. Common sizes:
- Mockup of a UI bar: `viewBox="0 0 640 200"` (wide, short)
- Component state: `viewBox="0 0 400 300"` (squarer)
- Icon / chip: `viewBox="0 0 64 64"`
- Full screen layout: `viewBox="0 0 800 500"`

### สี

ถ้าเอกสารหรือโปรเจกต์มีชุดสีอยู่แล้ว ให้ใช้ชุดนั้น ส่วนถ้ายังไม่มี ให้เสนอโทนจาก [`diagram-figures/references/colour-by-domain.md`](../diagram-figures/references/colour-by-domain.md) แล้วรอผู้ใช้ยืนยัน ส่วน token ตามหน้าที่ (`bg-canvas` · `accent-primary` · `state-*` …) ดูได้ใน [references/svg-snippets.md](references/svg-snippets.md) และ **1 เอกสารใช้ชุดสีเดียว**

### Reusable snippets

Window chrome, phone frame, button, card, status badge, running dot and tooltip snippets, plus the UI-state worked example, are in [references/svg-snippets.md](references/svg-snippets.md). Copy the structure and swap in the agreed colour tokens.

## 2 · External image files

Use when:
- Photo or screenshot
- Illustration too complex to author as SVG by hand (50+ shapes)
- Reusing the same image across many docs
- Generated by a design tool (Figma export, etc.)

### Folder convention

```
docs/
  figures/
    01-hover-state.svg
    02-empty-state.png
    architecture-overview.svg
    src/                      editable sources (.mmd · .drawio · .html)
```

- Put figures in `docs/figures/` (editable sources in `docs/figures/src/`) — relative to the doc · brand files (logo, icons) live in the project-root `assets/`, not here
- Name files `<doc-section-number>-<short-slug>.<ext>` so they sort with the doc
- Prefer `.svg` over `.png` when possible (scales, smaller, diff-friendly)

### Reference syntax

```markdown
![Hover state showing magnified Projects tile](assets/01-hover-state.svg)
```

- **Alt text** describes what the image shows, for accessibility — not "screenshot.png"
- Path is **relative to the markdown file**, not absolute
- For centered + sized images, wrap in HTML:

```markdown
<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/01-hover-state.svg" alt="Hover state" width="640"/>
</p>
```

### Creating SVG files

When the visual is too big to inline (>50 lines of SVG markup), save it as a file instead. Use the `Write` tool to create the SVG file alongside the doc.

## 3 · ASCII art

For quick layouts, state diagrams, and structural sketches that don't need pixel-perfect visuals. Renders identically in every viewer and in terminal/diff output.

Box-drawing characters plus worked layout sketch, state machine and curve examples are in [references/ascii-patterns.md](references/ascii-patterns.md).

Always wrap ASCII in a fenced code block (` ``` `) so spacing is preserved.

## 4 · Mermaid

**การเลือกชนิดไดอะแกรม ธีม กติกาความอ่านง่าย และป้ายภาษาไทย อยู่ใน `software-diagrams`**
ที่นี่บอกแค่ว่า *เมื่อไหร่ควรเลือก Mermaid แทนรูปแบบอื่น*

| เลือก Mermaid เมื่อ | เลือกอย่างอื่นเมื่อ |
|---|---|
| เป็นกล่องกับลูกศรที่เครื่องจัดวางให้ได้ | ถ้าต้องคุมตำแหน่งเองให้ใช้ inline SVG ส่วนรูปที่ต้องดูออกแบบมาให้ใช้ `diagram-figures` (HTML layout หรือ engine-svg-python) แล้วฝังเป็นไฟล์ภาพ |
| อยู่ในไฟล์ที่ต้อง diff ใน git | เป็นภาพหน้าจอจริง ให้ใช้ไฟล์ภาพ |
| ผู้อ่านเปิดใน GitHub หรือ Notion | ผู้อ่านเปิดในเอกสาร Word หรือสไลด์ ให้ใช้ไฟล์ภาพ |

## Combining formats in one doc

A full design spec usually mixes formats (SVG mockup, reference table, ASCII sketch, Mermaid state diagram, acceptance table). The 6-part pattern is in [references/combining-formats.md](references/combining-formats.md). Don't force everything into one format.

## Accessibility checklist

For every visual:

- [ ] **Inline SVG** has `role="img"` and `aria-label="<description>"`
- [ ] **Image file** has descriptive alt text (not "image.png")
- [ ] **Mermaid** diagrams have a 1-sentence caption above or below
- [ ] **ASCII art** has a prose summary nearby — screen readers will read the characters literally
- [ ] **Colour** is not the only signal — pair red badges with `!`, green dots with a label
- [ ] **Contrast** for text in SVG ≥ 4.5:1 against its background

## Anti-patterns

- ❌ **Text-only design docs** — "the icon is in the top-right" with no picture
- ❌ **Linking to Figma / external design tools as the only source** — visuals must render in the repo
- ❌ **PNG screenshots of text** — use the text, in a code block
- ❌ **SVG without `xmlns`** — GitHub silently fails to render
- ❌ **Inline SVG with 200+ lines** — extract to `assets/x.svg` and reference it
- ❌ **ASCII art outside a code fence** — proportional fonts will mangle alignment
- ❌ **Mixing Mermaid syntax versions** — stick to v10 syntax so GitHub renders it
- ❌ **Generated images checked in without source** — commit the `.svg` source, not just the `.png` export
- ❌ **Decorative emoji as visuals** — emoji ≠ a mockup; pair them with real diagrams

## Quick-start recipe

When the user asks for a design / mockup:

1. **Identify what kinds of visuals are needed** (UI state? flow? architecture?)
2. **Pick the format(s)** using the decision tree above
3. **For each visual:**
   - State a one-line caption
   - Emit the SVG/Mermaid/ASCII
   - Add `role="img"` + `aria-label` (SVG) or alt text (file)
4. **Add a feature reference table** below the visuals — what each element means
5. **Cross-check accessibility checklist** before delivery

Not sure a visual will render? Tell the user to preview it in GitHub or Notion.

## reference: combining-formats.md

# Combining formats in one doc

Used by [SKILL.md](../SKILL.md) · a full design spec usually mixes formats.

Pattern from `DockXI/docs/12-design-mockup.md`:

```
1. Inline SVG mockup of each UI state              ← "what it looks like"
2. Feature reference table                          ← "what it does"
3. ASCII layout sketch with measurements           ← "how it's positioned"
4. Mermaid state diagram                            ← "how it transitions"
5. ASCII / inline-SVG zoom curve                    ← "the math"
6. Acceptance criteria table                        ← "how we verify"
```

Don't force everything into one format. Each format is best at something different.

# Inline SVG snippets

Reusable building blocks for inline SVG mockups in markdown docs · used by [SKILL.md](../SKILL.md) §1

## สี — มาจากเนื้องาน ไม่ใช่จากตารางสำเร็จรูป

**อย่าเลือกสีเอง** ถ้าเอกสารหรือโปรเจกต์มีชุดสีอยู่แล้ว ให้ใช้ชุดนั้น
ถ้ายังไม่มี ให้เสนอโทนจากเนื้องานแล้วรอผู้ใช้ยืนยัน — การแพทย์เขียว · การเงินน้ำเงินเข้ม ·
อุตสาหกรรมเหลืองอำพัน · ราชการกรมท่า · ซอฟต์แวร์ทั่วไปน้ำเงิน (ตารางเต็มอยู่ใน [`diagram-figures/references/colour-by-domain.md`](../../diagram-figures/references/colour-by-domain.md))

กำหนดเป็น **token ตามหน้าที่** ไว้บนสุดของเอกสาร แล้วใช้ค่าเดียวกันทุกรูปในเอกสารนั้น:

| Token | หน้าที่ | ได้มาจาก |
|---|---|---|
| `bg-canvas` | พื้นหลังของรูป | เฉดเข้มสุด (โหมดมืด) หรืออ่อนสุด (โหมดสว่าง) |
| `bg-surface` | แผ่น พาเนล การ์ด | ต่างจาก canvas พอให้เห็นขอบโดยไม่ต้องตีเส้น |
| `bg-elevated` | ไทล์ที่ลอยขึ้นมาอีกชั้น | |
| `accent-primary` | จุดเน้น สถานะที่กำลังทำงาน | **สีหลักที่ผู้ใช้เลือก** |
| `text-primary` | ข้อความหลัก | contrast ≥ 4.5:1 กับพื้นที่มันวางอยู่ |
| `text-muted` | ข้อความรอง placeholder | `rgba(...,0.55)` ของ `text-primary` |
| `state-success` · `state-warning` · `state-danger` | สถานะ | **ไม่เปลี่ยนตามแบรนด์** — เขียวคือผ่าน แดงคือไม่ผ่านเสมอ |

**1 เอกสารใช้ชุดสีเดียว** — รูป 10 รูปในเอกสารเดียวที่สีไม่ตรงกัน อ่านยากกว่ารูปไม่สวยแต่สีตรงกัน

<text x="<tile-right-x>" y="<tile-top-y + 4>" text-anchor="middle" fill="#fff" font-family="system-ui" font-size="13" font-weight="500">!</text>
```

**Running dot (indicator below tile):**
```xml
<circle cx="<tile-center-x>" cy="<tile-bottom-y + 12>" r="4" fill="#4cc2ff"/>
```

**Tooltip text (no balloon — plain floating text):**
```xml
<text x="<tile-center-x>" y="<tile-top-y - 12>" text-anchor="middle" fill="#fff" font-family="system-ui" font-size="12" font-weight="500">Tooltip label</text>
```

## Worked example — UI state mockup

This is the pattern used in `DockXI/docs/12-design-mockup.md` and should be the default for showing UI feature states.

# skill: branded-document-design

Use when a Word, PowerPoint or PDF deliverable must look designed. Token palette, type scale, tested python-docx and python-pptx builders, Thai typography.

# Branded Document Design

> **ภาษา:** ถ้อยคำทุกบรรทัดเขียนตาม [`human-writing`](../human-writing/SKILL.md) — skill นี้บอกรูปแบบและโครง ส่วน human-writing บอกวิธีเขียนให้คนอ่านรู้เรื่อง

> **กฎข้อเดียวของ skill นี้:** เอกสารที่ส่งออกไปต้องดูออกว่าตั้งใจออกแบบ คือมีชุดสี ชุดขนาดตัวอักษร
> และช่องไฟที่เหมือนกันทุกหน้า ไม่ใช่เปิด Word แล้วพิมพ์เลย

## เมื่อไหร่ใช้ skill นี้

- ผลลัพธ์คือ **.docx / .pptx / .pdf** ที่ลูกค้า ผู้บริหาร หรือทีมอื่นจะเปิดดู
- เอกสารต้อง **เซ็นอนุมัติ** หรือแนบไปกับสัญญา/ข้อเสนอ
- เอกสารไทย–อังกฤษปนกัน (ถ้าตั้งฟอนต์ไม่ครบจะพังง่ายมาก)
- ต้องออกเอกสารแบบเดียวกันซ้ำ ๆ และอยากให้ทุกฉบับหน้าตาเหมือนกัน

## เมื่อไหร่ **ไม่** ใช้

- ผลลัพธ์เป็น markdown ในรีโป ให้ใช้ `polished-document-style`
- ต้องแค่ **อ่าน/แกะ** ไฟล์ Office ที่ได้รับมา ให้ใช้ `anthropic-skills:docx` · `xlsx` · `pptx` · `pdf`
- ไดอะแกรมในเอกสาร markdown ให้ใช้ `markdown-visuals`

**ลำดับที่ถูกต้อง:** เขียนเนื้อหาเป็น markdown ก่อน (polished-document-style)
→ ค่อยใช้ skill นี้ render เป็นไฟล์ส่งมอบ และแก้เนื้อหาที่ markdown เสมอ (markdown คือต้นฉบับ)

---

## 0 · สีมาจากเนื้องาน — ถามก่อนเริ่ม

**ถ้า markdown ต้นทางมี `doc-theme` อยู่แล้ว ให้ใช้ค่านั้น อย่าถามซ้ำ อย่าตั้งใหม่**
(ดู `polished-document-style` หัวข้อ "ธีมของเอกสาร")

ถ้ายังไม่มี **ห้ามเลือกสีเอง ห้ามใช้ค่าเริ่มต้นเงียบ ๆ** ให้ถามผู้ใช้ว่าจะใช้สีอะไร
ถ้าผู้ใช้ยังไม่ระบุ ให้เสนอจากเนื้องาน รอยืนยัน แล้ว**เขียนกลับลง `doc-theme`** ในไฟล์ markdown

| เนื้องาน | โทนที่เสนอ | เหตุผล |
|---|---|---|
| การแพทย์ · สุขภาพ | เขียวอมฟ้า · เขียว | ความสะอาด ความปลอดภัย |
| การเงิน · ธนาคาร | น้ำเงินเข้ม · เทาเงิน | ความมั่นคง |
| อุตสาหกรรม · โรงงาน | เหลืองอำพัน · เทาเหล็ก | เครื่องจักร การเตือน |
| การศึกษา | ม่วง · ส้มอ่อน | ความกระตือรือร้น |
| ค้าปลีก · อาหาร | ส้ม · แดงอมชมพู | ความอบอุ่น ความอยาก |
| ราชการ · กฎหมาย | กรมท่า · เลือดหมู | ความเป็นทางการ |
| ซอฟต์แวร์ทั่วไป | น้ำเงิน | ค่ากลางเมื่อไม่มีบริบทอื่น |

ถ้าลูกค้ามีแบรนด์อยู่แล้ว ให้ใช้สีแบรนด์ ตารางนี้ใช้เฉพาะตอนไม่มีอะไรให้ยึด

**สีหลักมีสีเดียว** เฉดอ่อนและเข้มทั้งหมดคำนวณจากสีนั้น ไม่เลือกเพิ่มทีละสี
สีที่ไม่ผูกกับสีหลักมีแค่สีสถานะ (สำเร็จ · เตือน · ผิดพลาด) และต้องคงความหมายเดิมเสมอ

---

## 1 · Design tokens — ห้าม hardcode สีนอกตารางนี้

ตารางนี้กำหนด**หน้าที่**ของแต่ละ token ไม่ได้กำหนดค่าสี
ค่าจริงมาจากข้อ 0 แล้วตั้งครั้งเดียวด้วย `use_brand(...)`

| Token | หน้าที่ | ได้มาจาก |
|-------|---------|----------|
| `brand` | หัวข้อ H1 · ตัวเลข KPI · ลิงก์ · แถบ accent | สีหลักที่ผู้ใช้เลือก |
| `brand_2` | accent รอง · ขีดใต้หัวข้อสไลด์ · ปลายไล่สี | เพื่อนบ้านของสีหลักบนวงล้อสี |
| `brand_deep` | หัวข้อ H2 · ตัวอักษรหัวตาราง | สีหลักผสมดำ ให้ contrast ≥ 7:1 บนพื้นขาว |
| `brand_tint` | พื้นหัวตาราง · การ์ด KPI · พื้นหน้าปก | สีหลักผสมขาวประมาณ 90% |
| `brand_tint_2` | แถวสลับ (zebra) ในตารางยาว | สีหลักผสมขาวประมาณ 96% |
| `text` | หัวข้อ H3 · ข้อความเน้น | เทาเข้มอมโทนเดียวกับสีหลัก |
| `text_body` | เนื้อความทั้งหมด | เทาเข้มอ่อนกว่า `text` 1 ขั้น **ไม่ใช่ดำสนิท เพราะดำสนิทล้าตา** |
| `text_muted` | คำบรรยายรูป · meta · footer | เทากลาง contrast ≥ 4.5:1 |
| `line` | เส้นตาราง เส้นคั่น | เทาอ่อนมาก เห็นได้แต่ไม่แย่งสายตา |

**สีสถานะ 6 ตัว** (แต่ละตัวมีคู่สีพื้นกับสีตัวอักษร): สำเร็จ · ข้อมูล · เตือน · ผิดพลาด · เน้น · เป็นกลาง
สีสถานะ**ไม่เปลี่ยนตามแบรนด์** เพราะเขียวคือผ่าน แดงคือไม่ผ่าน ในทุกเอกสาร
พื้นคือเฉดอ่อนมาก ตัวอักษรคือเฉดเข้มของสีเดียวกัน ให้ contrast ≥ 4.5:1

**ความหมายของแต่ละสี — เลือกสีตามความหมายเสมอ** (เหมือนกันทั้งเอกสารและไดอะแกรม)

| สี | หมายความว่า | ใช้กับ (callout / pill / กล่อง / เส้นในรูป) |
|---|---|---|
| 🔴 แดง | อันตราย · ห้าม · ลบทิ้ง · ผิดพลาด · เลยกำหนด | `critical` · สถานะ "ค้าง/ล้มเหลว" · ขั้นที่ทำลายข้อมูล · เส้นที่พัง |
| 🟠 เหลือง/ส้ม | ระวัง · รอดำเนินการ · ข้อแม้ · ทางที่ไม่ใช่เส้นหลัก | `warning` · สถานะ "กำลังทำ" · โซน/เส้นข้อยกเว้น (`#C77A11`) |
| 🟢 เขียว | สำเร็จ · ผ่าน · ปลอดภัย · เสร็จแล้ว | `success` · สถานะ "เสร็จ" · ผลลัพธ์ที่ยืนยันแล้ว |
| 🔵 น้ำเงิน | ข้อมูล · การกระทำหลัก · เส้นทางปกติ | `tip` · ปุ่มหลัก · กล่อง/เส้นเส้นทางหลัก (brand) |
| 🟣 ม่วง | คำถาม · ทางเลือก · หมายเหตุเสริม | `question` · ของเสริมที่ไม่บังคับ |
| ⚪ เทา | เป็นกลาง · ปิดใช้งาน · ของภายนอก | `note` · ระบบภายนอก · ส่วนที่ปิดอยู่ |

กฎเดียว: **เลือกสีตามความหมาย ไม่ใช่ตามความสวย** อย่าใช้แดงเพราะอยากให้เด่น ใช้แดงเฉพาะเมื่ออันตรายหรือผิดจริง และไดอะแกรมก็ใช้ชุดความหมายเดียวกันนี้ (ดู `software-diagrams` · `diagram-figures` ที่มี `EXCEPT_HUE` ส้มสำหรับทางที่ไม่ผ่านเส้นหลัก)

> **เกณฑ์ที่ต้องผ่านทุกชุดสี:** เนื้อความบนพื้น ≥ 4.5:1 · หัวข้อบนพื้น ≥ 7:1 ·
> พิมพ์ขาวดำแล้วยังแยกลำดับชั้นออก ถ้าไม่ผ่านให้ปรับความเข้ม ไม่เปลี่ยนสี
>
> **ตัวอย่างชุดสีที่เคยใช้จริง** (ไม่ใช่ค่ามาตรฐาน อย่าคัดลอกไปใช้โดยไม่ดูเนื้องาน) → `references/palette-examples.md`

> 💡 **เปลี่ยนแบรนด์ทั้งชุดในบรรทัดเดียว:**
> `use_brand(brand="C1121F", brand_deep="780000", brand_tint="FDECEC")`

### สเกลตัวอักษร (pt)

| ระดับ | Word | Slide | น้ำหนัก · สี |
|-------|------|-------|--------------|
| ชื่อบนปก | 20 | 40 | bold · `brand` (Word) / `brand_deep` (สไลด์) |
| H1 | 16 | 26 | bold · `brand` |
| H2 | 12.5 | — | bold · `brand_deep` |
| H3 | 11.5 | — | bold · `text` |
| เนื้อความ | 11 | 17 | regular · `text_body` |
| ตาราง | 11 | 12.5 | regular · `text_body` |
| คำบรรยาย/footer | 8.5–9 | 10–12 | italic หรือ regular · `text_muted` |

**อย่าเพิ่มขนาดนอกสเกลนี้** เพราะทุกขนาดที่เพิ่มทำให้เอกสารดูไม่สม่ำเสมอ และคนอ่านสังเกตเห็น

---

## 2 · ฟอนต์และภาษาไทย — จุดที่พังบ่อยที่สุด

ใช้ **Tahoma** เป็นค่าเริ่มต้น: มีทุกเครื่อง Windows/Office · วรรณยุกต์ไม่ชนสระ ·
bold อ่านออกชัด · ความสูง x-height ไทยกับอังกฤษใกล้เคียงกัน

> 🚨 **กับดัก complex script:** Word ถือว่าภาษาไทยเป็น *complex script* คนละชุดกับ latin
> ถ้าตั้งแค่ `run.font.size` / `run.font.bold` ตัวอักษรไทยจะ **ไม่เปลี่ยนตาม**
> ต้องตั้ง `w:szCs`, `w:bCs`, `w:iCs` และ `w:rFonts` ให้ครบทั้ง `ascii/hAnsi/cs/eastAsia`
> ฟังก์ชัน `style_run()` ใน `brandkit.py` จัดการให้แล้ว **ห้ามตั้งฟอนต์เองด้วยมือ**

กฎอื่นสำหรับเอกสารไทย:

- ระยะบรรทัด **1.3–1.35** (อังกฤษล้วนใช้ 1.15 ได้ แต่ไทยมีวรรณยุกต์และสระบน–ล่าง ต้องเว้นที่)
- **ห้ามจัดชิดขอบ 2 ด้าน (justify)** กับย่อหน้าไทย เพราะไทยไม่มีช่องว่างระหว่างคำ Word จะยืดคำจนเป็นรู
- LibreOffice ตัดคำไทยไม่เหมือน Word ถ้าจะส่ง PDF ให้ export จาก Word จริง
  หรืออย่างน้อยเปิด PDF ตรวจด้วยตาก่อนส่ง
- สร้าง PDF บน Linux ที่ไม่มี Tahoma ให้ใช้ **Loma** หรือ **Sarabun** แทน
  (ReportLab จัดวรรณยุกต์ไทยผิด ให้ใช้ python-docx→LibreOffice หรือ WeasyPrint แทน)
- เวลา preview บน Linux ตัวอักษรไทยจะดู **เล็กกว่า** latin เพราะฟอนต์แทนที่มี x-height ต่ำกว่า
  ไม่ใช่บั๊กของขนาดฟอนต์ บน Windows ที่มี Tahoma จริงจะสูงเท่ากัน จึงให้ตรวจรอบสุดท้ายจาก Word

---

## 3 · โครงหน้าเอกสาร Word

```
หน้าปก        โลโก้กลาง → ชื่อเอกสาร (brand, bold) → ชื่อระบบ (text, bold)
              → บรรทัดเวอร์ชัน/วันที่ (9pt) → หมายเหตุการแก้ไข (8pt เอียง เทา)
              → ขึ้นหน้าใหม่
สารบัญ        field TOC (ผู้ใช้กด F9 อัปเดต) → ขึ้นหน้าใหม่
เนื้อหา        H1 มีเลขข้อเสมอ ("1. ภาพรวมระบบ") · H2 เป็น "1.1"
              ทุก H1/H2/H3 ตั้ง keep-with-next กันหัวข้อค้างท้ายหน้า
ท้ายเอกสาร    ตารางลงนามอนุมัติ
footer        "หน้า N" กลางหน้า สีเทา 9pt
```

หน้ากระดาษ A4 · ขอบ บน/ล่าง 2.2 ซม. · ซ้าย/ขวา 2.0 ซม. ได้ความกว้างเนื้อหา ≈ **9360 twips**
(ใช้ตัวเลขนี้ตั้งความกว้างคอลัมน์ตารางให้รวมกันพอดี)

---

## 4 · องค์ประกอบที่ใช้ซ้ำ

| องค์ประกอบ | หน้าตา | เมธอด |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| หน้าปก | โลโก้ + ชื่อสีแบรนด์ กลางหน้า | `cover()` |
| ตาราง | หัวพื้น `brand_tint` ตัวอักษร `brand_deep` เส้นเทาบาง หัวซ้ำทุกหน้า | `table()` |
| ตารางสถานะ | คอลัมน์สถานะย้อมสีตามค่า | `pill_table()` |
| แถบตัวเลขสรุป | การ์ดพื้นฟ้าอ่อน ตัวเลขใหญ่สีแบรนด์ + ป้ายเทาเล็ก | `kpi_row()` |
| กล่องข้อความ | พื้นสีอ่อน + แถบสีหนาด้านซ้าย + อีโมจิ 1 ตัว | `callout()` |
| รูปพร้อมคำบรรยาย | รูปกลางหน้า + "รูปที่ N — ..." เอียงเทาใต้รูป | `figure()` |
| บล็อกโค้ด | พื้นเทาอ่อน ฟอนต์ Consolas 9pt | `code()` |
| ตารางเซ็น | บทบาท / ชื่อ / ลายเซ็น / วันที่ | `signoff()` |

**สัดส่วนที่พอดี:** callout ไม่เกิน 3–5 กล่องต่อ 10 หน้า · แถบตัวเลขสรุป (KPI strip) 3–5 ช่อง (ตั้งแต่ 6 ช่อง ตัวเลขจะเล็กจนไม่เด่น) ·
ตารางเกิน 6 คอลัมน์ให้เปลี่ยนเป็นหน้าแนวนอน (`landscape_section()`)

---

## 5 · วิธีใช้ brandkit

```python
import sys; sys.path.insert(0, "scripts")     # หรือ copy brandkit.py มาไว้ข้างงาน
from brandkit import BrandDoc, use_brand, to_pdf

doc = BrandDoc()                                # A4 · Tahoma · โทน Apps Track
doc.cover("เอกสารข้อกำหนดซอฟต์แวร์ (Software Specification)",
          subtitle="ระบบ Apps Track — Project Control & Monitor",
          meta="เวอร์ชันเอกสาร 3.5  •  ปรับปรุง 19 กรกฎาคม 2026",
          logo="asset/AppsTrack_Logo_Badge.png")
doc.toc()

doc.h1("1. ภาพรวมระบบ")
doc.para("eitprojects เป็นระบบบริหารและติดตามโครงการ ...")
doc.kpi_row([("19", "โครงการ"), ("115", "Work items"), ("103", "Open tasks")])
doc.table(["หัวข้อ", "รายละเอียด"],
          [["URL ระบบ", "https://project.eitaccount.cloud"]],
          widths=[2600, 6760])                  # รวม = 9360
doc.callout("warning", "ข้อควรระวัง", "Token ต้องไม่ถูกแสดงกลับใน UI หลังบันทึก")
doc.figure("diagrams/context.png", "ภาพรวมระบบและขอบเขตการใช้งาน", number=1)
doc.pill_table(["รหัส", "งาน", "สถานะ"], rows, status_col=2,
               palette={"เสร็จ": "green", "กำลังทำ": "amber", "ค้าง": "red"})
doc.signoff([("Product Owner", "—"), ("Tech Lead", "—")])
doc.save("SRS.docx")
```

สไลด์ใช้ `brandkit_pptx.py` ซึ่งกินโทเคนชุดเดียวกัน:

```python
from brandkit_pptx import BrandDeck
d = BrandDeck()                                  # 16:9
d.title_slide("Apps Track", "Project Control & Monitor", "19 กรกฎาคม 2026")
d.section("1 · ภาพรวมระบบ", kicker="ส่วนที่ 1")
d.bullets_slide("ขอบเขตงาน", ["...", "..."], subtitle="สรุปจาก SRS v3.5")
d.kpi_slide("ตัวเลขสำคัญ", [("19", "โครงการ"), ("115", "Work items")])
d.table_slide("สถานะ Milestone", headers, rows, col_widths=[1, 4, 2, 2],
              status_col=3, palette={"เสร็จ": "green", "กำลังทำ": "amber"})
d.image_slide("สถาปัตยกรรม", "diagrams/arch.png", caption="ภาพรวมองค์ประกอบ")
d.save("deck.pptx")
```

เมธอดทั้งหมดอยู่ใน `references/api.md` ส่วนไฟล์ตัวอย่างที่รันได้จริงคือ
`scripts/example_srs.py`

## 6 · ตรวจงานด้วยตา — ขั้นตอนที่ห้ามข้าม

เอกสารที่ยังไม่มีใครเปิดดูหน้าจริง ถือว่ายังไม่เสร็จ เพราะอาจมีตารางล้นขอบ หัวข้อค้างท้ายหน้า
วรรณยุกต์ลอย ปัญหาเหล่านี้ดูจากโค้ดไม่เห็น

```bash
soffice --headless --convert-to pdf --outdir out SRS.docx
pdftoppm -png -r 80 out/SRS.pdf out/page      # ได้ page-01.png, page-02.png ...
```

แล้ว **เปิดภาพดูจริงทุกหน้า** (Read tool) ก่อนส่งมอบ ตรวจตามนี้:

- [ ] ไม่มีตารางล้นขอบกระดาษ คอลัมน์กว้างพอดี ไม่มีคำถูกบีบขึ้นบรรทัดใหม่แปลก ๆ
- [ ] ไม่มีหัวข้อค้างอยู่บรรทัดสุดท้ายของหน้า
- [ ] วรรณยุกต์/สระไทยไม่ชนกัน และไม่มีตัวอักษรกลายเป็นกล่องสี่เหลี่ยม
- [ ] หน้าปกไม่มีข้อความล้นหรือตกขอบ
- [ ] ช่องไฟก่อน/หลังตารางและ callout เท่ากันทั้งเอกสาร
- [ ] footer เลขหน้าครบทุกหน้า
- [ ] ไม่มี TBD / Lorem ipsum / placeholder หลงเหลือ

---

## 7 · Anti-patterns

- ❌ **ใช้ Heading style ที่มากับ Word** — จะทับสีที่ตั้งไว้ ให้ใช้ `h1()/h2()/h3()`
  ซึ่งตั้ง `outlineLvl` เอง สารบัญ (TOC) จึงยังเห็นหัวข้อ
- ❌ **เส้นตารางดำหนาแบบค่าเริ่มต้น** — เอกสารดูเก่าทันที ใช้เส้นสี `line` หนา 0.5pt
- ❌ **ตัวอักษรสีดำสนิท** — ให้ใช้ `text_body` ซึ่งเป็นเทาเข้ม เนื้อความจะนุ่มขึ้นมาก
- ❌ **หัวตารางตัวหนาแต่ไม่มีพื้นสี** — ตารางข้ามหน้าแล้วคนอ่านไม่รู้ว่าเริ่มตรงไหน
- ❌ **ปล่อยความกว้างคอลัมน์ให้ Word คิดเอง** — ต้อง `fixed_widths()` เสมอ
  ไม่งั้นคอลัมน์รหัสจะกว้างเท่าคอลัมน์รายละเอียด
- ❌ **อีโมจิเยอะเกิน** — 1 ตัวต่อ callout พอ ไม่ใส่ในหัวข้อทุกอัน
- ❌ **ส่งไฟล์โดยไม่เคย render ดู** — ดูข้อ 6
- ❌ **สร้าง .docx โดยไม่เก็บ markdown ต้นฉบับ** — รอบหน้าแก้ไม่ได้

---

## 8 · เชื่อมกับ skill อื่น

| ต้องการ | ใช้คู่กับ |
|---------|-----------|
| โครงเนื้อหา/สำนวนเอกสารทางการ · **ธีมสีของเอกสาร** | `polished-document-style` |
| ไดอะแกรมที่จะเอามาแปะเป็นรูป | `markdown-visuals` → export PNG → `figure()` |
| อ่านไฟล์ Office ที่ลูกค้าส่งมา | `anthropic-skills:docx` · `xlsx` · `pptx` · `pdf` |
| สเปรดชีตส่งมอบ | `anthropic-skills:xlsx` (โทเคนสีชุดเดียวกันใช้ได้) |
| เนื้อหาและความครบถ้วนของเอกสาร SRS | `srs-writing` |
| โครงเรื่องและเลย์เอาต์ของสไลด์ | `presentation-design` |
| ไดอะแกรมที่วาดด้วย Mermaid ธีมเดียวกัน | `software-diagrams` |
| ที่มาของระบบสีและตัวอักษร · โลโก้ | `graphic-design` |

---

## ตัวย่อ

เขียนตัวย่อเต็มครั้งแรกเสมอ แล้ววงเล็บตัวย่อไว้ — เช่น Model Context Protocol (MCP)
หลังจากนั้นใช้ตัวย่อได้ ดูรายละเอียดใน skill `spell-out-abbreviations`

## brandkit.py — Word (.docx)

### สร้างเอกสาร

```python
BrandDoc(path_template=None, page="A4", margins_cm=(2.2, 2.0, 2.2, 2.0),
         footer_text="หน้า")
```

| พารามิเตอร์ | ความหมาย |
|-------------|----------|
| `path_template` | ไฟล์ .docx/.dotx ที่ใช้เป็นแม่แบบ (มี header/logo ขององค์กรอยู่แล้ว) |
| `page` | `"A4"` หรือ `"Letter"` |
| `margins_cm` | (บน, ขวา, ล่าง, ซ้าย) |
| `footer_text` | คำนำหน้าเลขหน้า · `""` = เลขเปล่า |

### บล็อกระดับหน้า

| เมธอด | หมายเหตุ |
|-------|----------|
| `cover(title, subtitle, meta, note, logo, logo_width_cm=2.6, top_space_pt=150, page_break=True)` | โลโก้รับได้ทั้ง .png และ .emf แต่ **.svg ใช้ไม่ได้ใน python-docx** ต้องแปลงเป็น PNG ก่อน (`rsvg-convert -w 600` หรือ `cairosvg`) |
| `toc(heading="สารบัญ", levels="1-3")` | แทรก field TOC แล้วใน Word กด **Ctrl+A แล้ว F9** เพื่อให้รายการขึ้น (ตอนสร้างจะยังว่าง) |
| `page_break()` | |
| `landscape_section()` | เปิดส่วนแนวนอนสำหรับตารางกว้าง |

### หัวข้อและข้อความ

| เมธอด | ผลลัพธ์ |
|-------|---------|
| `h1(text)` `h2(text)` `h3(text)` | 16 / 12.5 / 11.5 pt · bold · brand / brand_deep / text · ตั้ง `outlineLvl` ให้ TOC เห็น |
| `para(text, size, color, bold, italic, align, space_after)` | `align` = `"center"｜"right"｜"justify"` (ไทยอย่าใช้ justify) |
| `rich([(text, opts), ...])` | หลายรูปแบบในย่อหน้าเดียว เช่น `[("สถานะ: ", {"bold": True}), ("อนุมัติ", {"color": "green"})]` |
| `bullets([...], style="List Bullet")` | `style="List Number"` สำหรับเลขลำดับ |
| `code(text)` | บล็อกโค้ดพื้นเทา |

### ตารางและข้อมูล

| เมธอด | หมายเหตุ |
|-------|----------|
| `table(headers, rows, widths=None, zebra=False, align=None, first_col_bold=False)` | `widths` หน่วย twips รวม **9360** สำหรับ A4 ขอบ 2 ซม. · `align` = list ต่อคอลัมน์ |
| `pill_table(headers, rows, status_col, palette, widths)` | `palette = {"เสร็จ": "green", "ค้าง": "red"}` · โทนที่ใช้ได้: green blue amber red violet grey |
| `kpi_row([(value, label), ...])` | 3–5 ช่องพอดี |
| `signoff([(role, name), ...])` | ตารางเซ็นอนุมัติ |

### อื่น ๆ

| เมธอด | หมายเหตุ |
|-------|----------|
| `callout(kind, title, body)` | kind = `tip｜note｜warning｜critical｜success｜question` |
| `figure(image_path, caption, width_cm=15.5, number=None)` | `number=1` จะขึ้นต้นคำบรรยายว่า "รูปที่ 1 — " |
| `save(path)` | |

### ฟังก์ชันระดับโมดูล

| ฟังก์ชัน | ใช้เมื่อ |
|----------|---------|
| `use_brand(**tokens)` | เปลี่ยนชุดสีทั้งชุด ต้องเรียก **ก่อน** สร้าง `BrandDoc` |
| `style_run(run, size, color, bold, italic, mono)` | ตั้งฟอนต์เอง (ครอบคลุม complex-script ให้แล้ว) |
| `shade(cell, token)` · `left_accent(cell, token, size)` | ระบายพื้น / แถบสีซ้ายของเซลล์ |
| `fixed_widths(table, widths)` | บังคับความกว้างคอลัมน์ |
| `set_borders(table)` · `no_borders(table)` | |
| `repeat_header(row)` · `keep_with_next(paragraph)` | |
| `add_field(paragraph, "PAGE")` | แทรก field ของ Word |
| `to_pdf(docx_path, outdir)` | เรียก LibreOffice แปลงเป็น PDF |

---

## brandkit_pptx.py — สไลด์ (.pptx)

```python
BrandDeck(template=None)      # 16:9 (13.333 × 7.5 นิ้ว)
```

| เมธอด | สไลด์ที่ได้ |
|-------|-------------|
| `title_slide(title, subtitle, meta)` | พื้นฟ้าอ่อน + เส้นแบรนด์คั่น |
| `section(title, kicker=None)` | แถบแบรนด์แนวตั้งซ้าย + ชื่อส่วน |
| `bullets_slide(title, items, subtitle=None)` | หัวข้อ + ขีดม่วงใต้หัวข้อ + bullet 17pt |
| `kpi_slide(title, items, subtitle=None)` | การ์ดตัวเลข |
| `table_slide(title, headers, rows, col_widths, subtitle, status_col, palette)` | `col_widths` เป็นสัดส่วน เช่น `[1, 4, 2, 2]` |
| `image_slide(title, image_path, caption, subtitle)` | รูปกลางสไลด์ พอดีกรอบอัตโนมัติ |
| `quote_slide(text, source)` | สไลด์คำพูด/ข้อสรุป |
| `save(path)` | |

**ข้อจำกัดที่ต้องรู้**

- สไลด์ทุกอันสร้างจาก layout ว่าง (`slide_layouts[6]`) จึงไม่มีช่อง placeholder ให้แก้ใน PowerPoint
  แบบเทมเพลตปกติ ถ้าลูกค้าต้องแก้เองเยอะ ให้ส่ง `template=` เป็นไฟล์ .pptx ขององค์กรแทน
- ตารางใน python-pptx ไม่มี API ปิดเส้นขอบตรง ๆ ถ้าอยากได้ตารางไม่มีเส้น ให้เรียงกล่องข้อความแทน
- ความสูงแถวตารางเป็นค่าต่ำสุด ข้อความยาวจะดันแถวสูงขึ้นเอง ให้เผื่อพื้นที่

## สูตรความกว้างคอลัมน์ (Word)

| จำนวนคอลัมน์ | ตัวอย่าง widths (รวม 9360) |
|:---:|---|
| 2 | `[2600, 6760]` — หัวข้อ/รายละเอียด |
| 3 | `[1400, 5960, 2000]` — รหัส/รายการ/ผู้รับผิดชอบ |
| 4 | `[1100, 4200, 1900, 2160]` — รหัส/รายการ/ผู้รับผิดชอบ/สถานะ |
| 5 | `[1000, 1800, 2560, 2000, 2000]` |
| 6 ขึ้นไป | ใช้ `landscape_section()` (พื้นที่ ≈ 14700 twips) |

# ตัวอย่างชุดสีที่เคยใช้จริง

> ⚠️ **นี่คือตัวอย่าง ไม่ใช่ค่ามาตรฐาน**
> เลือกสีจากเนื้องานตามข้อ 0 ของ `SKILL.md` ก่อนเสมอ
> ใช้ไฟล์นี้เพื่อดูว่าชุดที่ครบและผ่านเกณฑ์ contrast หน้าตาเป็นอย่างไร ไม่ใช่เพื่อคัดลอก

## ชุด A — น้ำเงิน–ม่วง (ซอฟต์แวร์ทั่วไป · สกัดจาก Apps Track)

โทนสว่าง โปร่ง นุ่มนวล ตัวอักษรเทาเย็น

```python
use_brand(
    brand="2A78D6", brand_2="6A5CD6", brand_deep="2A4C86",
    brand_tint="EDF1FB", brand_tint_2="F6F8FD",
    text="333B4A", text_body="414957", text_muted="7D8492", line="E4E7EE",
)
```

## ชุด B — เขียวอมฟ้า (การแพทย์ · สุขภาพ)

```python
use_brand(
    brand="0E8F86", brand_2="2F9E6E", brand_deep="0B5F5A",
    brand_tint="E6F4F2", brand_tint_2="F3FAF9",

## ชุด D — เหลืองอำพัน + เทาเหล็ก (อุตสาหกรรม · โรงงาน)

accent อุ่นบนโครงเทาเย็น — ใช้ accent เฉพาะจุดที่ต้องการให้สังเกต ไม่ใช่ทั้งหน้า

```python
use_brand(
    brand="B57509", brand_2="8C5A2B", brand_deep="7A4E05",
    brand_tint="FBF2E1", brand_tint_2="FDF9F1",
    text="2F3439", text_body="3E444A", text_muted="7B838B", line="E5E8EA",
)
```

## สีสถานะ — ชุดเดียวกันทุกแบรนด์

สีสถานะ**ไม่เปลี่ยนตามแบรนด์** เพราะความหมายของมันคงที่

| สถานะ | พื้น | ตัวอักษร |
|---|---|---|
| สำเร็จ | `E9F7EF` | `17794A` |
| ข้อมูล | `EAF2FD` | `2160AB` |
| เตือน | `FDF5E4` | `96660D` |
| ผิดพลาด | `FDEDEC` | `A63A34` |
| เน้น | `F1EEFC` | `52439F` |
| เป็นกลาง | `F2F4F8` | `626A7A` |

> ถ้าสีแบรนด์ชนกับสีสถานะตัวใดตัวหนึ่ง (เช่น แบรนด์เป็นเขียว) ให้เปลี่ยน**สีแบรนด์ในบริบทนั้น**
> อย่าเปลี่ยนสีสถานะ — ผู้อ่านตีความเขียวว่าผ่านไปแล้วก่อนอ่านข้อความ

## วิธีตรวจก่อนใช้

1. เนื้อความบนพื้น ≥ 4.5:1 · หัวข้อบนพื้น ≥ 7:1
2. พิมพ์ขาวดำแล้วยังแยกหัวข้อกับเนื้อความออก
3. เปิดไฟล์ที่เรนเดอร์แล้วดูด้วยตา ไม่ใช่เชื่อค่าในตาราง
