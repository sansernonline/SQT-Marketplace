# skill: seo-audit-checklist

Use when auditing a website's SEO health, reviewing a page for SEO issues, preparing an SEO improvement plan, or doing pre-launch SEO checks. Covers technical, on-page, content, and off-page SEO with prioritized findings.

# SEO Audit Checklist

## When to use this skill

- Auditing an existing website for SEO issues
- Reviewing a new page before launch
- Diagnosing traffic drops
- Quarterly SEO health checks

## Audit Process

1. **Define scope** — Full site? Single page? Specific section?
2. **Run automated checks** — Lighthouse, PageSpeed, Screaming Frog
3. **Manual review** using the checklist below
4. **Prioritize findings** by impact + effort
5. **Document with actionable recommendations**

## Findings Severity

| Level | Impact | Examples |
|-------|--------|----------|
| 🔴 **Critical** | Blocks indexing or major ranking loss | noindex on important pages, broken sitemap, mobile unfriendly |
| 🟠 **High** | Significant ranking impact | Missing titles, slow Core Web Vitals, duplicate content |
| 🟡 **Medium** | Moderate impact | Suboptimal meta descriptions, thin content, weak internal links |
| 🟢 **Low** | Minor improvements | Image alt text gaps, schema enhancements |

## Quality Checklist for the Audit Itself

- [ ] Recommendations are specific and actionable
- [ ] Impact estimated where possible
- [ ] Quick wins identified separately
- [ ] Tied to business goals, not just SEO metrics

## Anti-patterns

- ❌ Audit without business context (ranking for irrelevant terms)
- ❌ All findings as "critical" — be honest about priorities
- ❌ Recommendations without "how" (just "improve content")
- ❌ Ignoring user experience for SEO gains
- ❌ Audit that's a list of tool screenshots, not insights
- ❌ Recommendations that contradict accessibility/UX best practices

## Document Look

This skill decides **what goes in** the document. It does not decide **how it looks** —
load the matching skill before writing, not after:

| What is being handed over | Load |
|---|---|
| Markdown someone reads (repo, wiki, issue tracker) | `polished-document-style` |
| A rendered `.docx` / `.pptx` / PDF a stakeholder signs off on | `branded-document-design` |
| The point needs a picture to land | `markdown-visuals`, then `software-diagrams` |

Default formatting is not neutral — it reads as unfinished work.

# skill: simplicity-first

Use when producing a document, design, architecture or plan — BRD, FSD, ADR, roadmap, UX or API design, sprint plan. Defaults to the simplest version that works and applies the "could a tired teammate follow this in 6 months?" test before delivery. Rejects buzzwords, premature abstraction and unnecessary layers. For code use lazy-coding instead.

# Simplicity First

> The best architecture has the fewest moving parts. The best plan is the one a
> teammate can follow with no context.

This skill covers **non-code outputs** — documents, plans, architecture, and
designs. For code, use `lazy-coding`.

## The one test

Before submitting, ask:

> Could a tired teammate understand this in 6 months, with no prior context?

If "no" or "not sure" → simplify.

## 5 principles

1. **Start with the simplest thing that works.** Add complexity only when something breaks.
2. **Reduce moving parts.** Each component adds failure modes, ops burden, and docs. Default to one thing.
3. **Use familiar patterns.** Boring, proven tech for critical paths. Save novelty for low-risk experiments.
4. **Optimize for reading.** It's read far more often than written.
5. **Delete &gt; add.** The best edit removes something. The worst adds a layer for an imagined future need.

## By output type

### Documents (BRD, FSD, ADR)

Do: short sentences (≤ 20 words), plain English, one idea per paragraph, an
example for every abstract point, tables for structured data.

Avoid: marketing-speak ("revolutionary", "best-in-class", "synergy"), undefined
jargon, walls of text, hedging ("might possibly potentially"), acronym soup.

### Architecture

Do: monolith first (split only when a bottleneck is proven), familiar stack,
standard patterns (REST, queues, caches), single source of truth per data type.

Avoid: microservices for small teams, distributed-everything, multi-master
databases before you must, event-driven by default (sync is simpler).

### Plans

Do: 3-5 priorities (not 20), a named owner per item, measurable success
criteria, realistic timelines with buffer, cut scope to fit time.

Avoid: vague goals ("improve quality"), 50-item lists (= no priority),
aspirational dates with no buffer, plans without success metrics.

### Designs (UX, API)

Do: fewest steps to the user's goal, reuse existing patterns, stay consistent
across screens, defaults that work for 80%, progressive disclosure.

Avoid: novel interactions where a standard one works, 10-step flows when 3
work, required fields with no smart default, hidden features needing tutorials.

## The 3-question filter

Before adding any new component, configuration option, or pattern:

1. Is there real evidence we need this **now** (not "might need")?
2. Is there a simpler way? (Sleep on it. Often yes.)
3. What's the cost of **not** adding it? (Often nothing, or a small refactor later.)

Two or more answers point to "simpler is fine" → don't add it.

## Examples

**API description**

❌ "This sophisticated, enterprise-grade endpoint leverages state-of-the-art
authentication to facilitate the seamless retrieval of user profile data."

✅ "`GET /users/{id}` returns a user profile. Requires a Bearer token. Use
`?fields=name,email` to limit the response."

**Sprint goal**

❌ "Improve overall product quality and customer satisfaction through various
initiatives."

✅ "Reduce login errors by 50% (8% → 4%): fix timeout bug (2d), retry on
transient errors (1d), clearer error messages (1d)."

**Architecture for a new feature**

❌ "Event-sourced microservice with CQRS, Kafka ingestion, Redis cache, and a
dedicated auth service."

✅ "Add an endpoint to the existing API. One Postgres table for state. Standard
auth middleware. Log to the existing system."

## Anti-patterns to reject

- **Future-proofing** — abstractions for needs that never arrive.
- **"It might scale"** — infra for 1M users while you have 1k.
- **Layer cake** — 6 layers where 90% just pass through.
- **Resume-driven design** — fancy tech to look sophisticated.
- **Buzzword stacking** — "cloud-native event-driven AI-powered".

## Pre-submit checklist

- [ ] A tired teammate would understand this in 6 months.
- [ ] Nothing can be deleted without losing meaning.
- [ ] No jargon the audience won't know.
- [ ] Every abstract claim has an example.
- [ ] I could explain the whole thing in two sentences.

If any answer is "no" → simplify before delivering.
