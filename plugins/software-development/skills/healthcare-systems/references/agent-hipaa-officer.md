## Patient Rights (Privacy Rule)

Patients can:
- **Access** their PHI (must respond within 30 days)
- **Amend** their PHI (request, you can decline with reason)
- **Request restrictions** on uses/disclosures
- **Request confidential communications** (alternate address, etc.)
- **Account of disclosures** (last 6 years)
- **File complaints**

Build features to support all of these.

## Business Associate Agreements (BAAs)

### Who needs a BAA?

```
You (Covered Entity)
   │
   ├──► AWS/Azure/GCP (cloud provider)        ← BAA required
   ├──► Sentry (error tracking)                ← BAA required (sees PHI in errors)
   ├──► Stripe (payment processor)             ← usually no BAA: payment processing alone is exempt (HIPAA §1179); BAA needed only if you send other PHI
   ├──► Email provider (SendGrid/SES)          ← BAA required (sends PHI)
   ├──► CRM (HubSpot/Salesforce)               ← BAA required (stores PHI)
   ├──► Analytics (Mixpanel/Amplitude)         ← BAA required IF receives PHI
   └──► Internal contractors                   ← BAA required
```

### BAA must include

- Permitted/required uses of PHI
- Subcontractor agreements
- Breach notification obligations
- Termination provisions
- Return/destruction of PHI

## Breach Response Workflow

    A[Potential breach detected] --> B[Stop the bleeding]
    B --> C[Risk assessment within 24h]
    C --> D{Was PHI compromised?}
    D -->|No, low risk| E[Document + close]
    D -->|Yes, risk to PHI| F[Required notifications]
    F --> G[Notify individuals within 60 days]
    F --> I{500+ affected?}
    I -->|Yes| J[Notify OCR + media within 60 days of discovery]
    I -->|No| K[Log it; notify OCR within 60 days after the calendar year ends - about 1 March]
    J --> L[Document everything]
    K --> L
    G --> L
```

Deadlines match the table in [`hipaa-compliance.md` → Breach Notification Thresholds](hipaa-compliance.md#breach-notification-thresholds) (HHS Breach Notification Rule, checked 22 Oct 2026).

### Risk assessment factors

1. Nature + extent of PHI involved
2. Unauthorized person who received PHI
3. Whether PHI actually acquired/viewed
4. Mitigation taken

## Common HIPAA Gotchas

### "I removed the name, it's de-identified"
**No.** HIPAA Safe Harbor requires removing **18 identifiers**:
1. Names
2. Addresses (smaller than state)
3. Dates (except year) of birth, death, admission, etc. — and ages over 89 (group them as "90 or older")
4. Phone numbers
5. Fax numbers
6. Email addresses
7. SSN
8. Medical record numbers
9. Health plan IDs
10. Account numbers
11. License/certificate numbers
12. Vehicle identifiers (VIN, plate)
13. Device identifiers
14. URLs
15. IP addresses
16. Biometric identifiers
17. Photographs
18. Any other unique identifier

OR use expert determination (statistical method).

### "It's not in production yet"
**Still covered** if real PHI. Use synthetic data in non-prod.

### "Vendor said they're HIPAA compliant"
**Not enough.** Need signed BAA in your records.

### "We log everything for debugging"
**Audit log of audit logs.** PHI in logs = audit log itself contains PHI.
