# Blameless Postmortem Template

## When to use this skill

- After any incident affecting production (SEV1-SEV3)
- After a near-miss that could have been a major incident
- After significant bugs that reached production
- After a security incident

## Core Principles

1. **Blameless** — focus on systems and processes, not individuals
2. **Honest** — don't soften facts to protect feelings
3. **Actionable** — every postmortem produces concrete action items
4. **Educational** — others should learn from this

## Severity Levels

| Level | Definition | Response Time |
|-------|-----------|---------------|
| **SEV1** | Total outage, data loss, security breach | Immediate, 24/7 |
| **SEV2** | Major feature down, significant user impact | Within 1 hour |
| **SEV3** | Degraded service, partial impact | Within business hours |
| **SEV4** | Minor issue, no user impact | Next business day |

## Output Template

```markdown
# Postmortem: <Short Incident Title>

**Date of Incident:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Date of Postmortem:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Severity:** SEV1 | SEV2 | SEV3 | SEV4
**Duration:** XX hours XX minutes
**Authors:** <names>
**Status:** Draft | Final

## 1. Summary

<3-5 sentences for executives: what happened, impact, what we did, what we learned>

## 2. Impact

- **User-facing:** Yes | No
- **Users affected:** ~XX,XXX (X%)
- **Duration:** XX min
- **Revenue impact:** $XXX (if known)
- **Data loss:** None | Minor | Significant
- **SLA breached:** Yes | No
- **Regulatory implications:** None | <describe>

## 3. Timeline

All times in UTC.

| Time | Event |
|------|-------|
| HH:MM | First customer complaint |
| HH:MM | On-call paged by alert |
| HH:MM | Investigation started |
| HH:MM | Root cause identified |
| HH:MM | Mitigation deployed |
| HH:MM | Service restored |
| HH:MM | All clear confirmed |

## 4. What Happened (Detailed)

### Detection
How was the incident detected? Was it automated alerting or customer report?
- Time to detect (TTD): XX minutes
- Could we have detected faster? How?

### Investigation
What did we look at? What did we rule out?
- Tools used: ...
- Wrong turns / red herrings: ...

### Mitigation
What stopped the bleeding? (Not necessarily the fix)
- Time to mitigate (TTM): XX minutes

### Resolution
What was the permanent fix?
- Time to resolve (TTR): XX minutes

## 5. Root Cause Analysis

Use **5 Whys** technique:

- Why did the service go down? → Database queries timed out
- Why did queries time out? → Connection pool exhausted
- Why was the pool exhausted? → A new endpoint didn't release connections
- Why didn't it release connections? → Missing `finally` block
- Why wasn't this caught? → No load tests for that endpoint

**Root cause:** <one-sentence statement>

**Contributing factors:**
- ...
- ...

## 6. What Went Well

- Monitoring alerted within X minutes
- Rollback completed quickly thanks to ...
- Team collaboration on Slack was effective
- ...

## 7. What Went Wrong

- Took X minutes longer than needed because ...
- Runbook was outdated
- Required engineer was offline; no backup
- ...

## 8. Where We Got Lucky

- Issue happened during business hours; would have been worse at night
- Customer X didn't notice because they were also having maintenance
- ...

## 9. Action Items

| # | Action | Owner | Type | Priority | Due Date |
|---|--------|-------|------|----------|----------|
| 1 | Add monitoring for X | @alice | Prevent | P1 | YYYY-MM-DD |
| 2 | Update runbook | @bob | Mitigate | P2 | YYYY-MM-DD |
| 3 | Add load test for endpoint | @charlie | Prevent | P1 | YYYY-MM-DD |

**Action types:**
- **Prevent:** stops this from happening again
- **Detect:** catches it sooner if it happens
- **Mitigate:** reduces impact when it happens
- **Process:** improves how we respond

## 10. Lessons Learned

What can other teams learn from this?
- Lesson 1: ...
- Lesson 2: ...

## Blameless Language Guide

| ❌ Blameful | ✅ Blameless |
|------------|--------------|
| "Alice deployed the bug" | "A bug was deployed in PR #123" |
| "Bob should have caught this in review" | "The review process didn't catch this; we should add automated checks" |
| "QA missed this case" | "Our test coverage didn't include this scenario" |
| "Someone forgot to..." | "The process doesn't ensure that..." |
| "Human error" | "The system allowed the mistake to happen" |

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Timeline includes specific times (not vague "morning of")
- [ ] Root cause goes deep enough (not just "bug in code")
- [ ] Action items have owners AND due dates
- [ ] Action items are tracked in actual ticket system
- [ ] Blameless language throughout
- [ ] Reviewed by someone NOT involved in incident
- [ ] Shared with broader team for learning

## Common Mistakes

- ❌ "Lessons learned: be more careful" — not actionable
- ❌ Single root cause when there are usually multiple factors
- ❌ Action items without owners → never done
- ❌ Skipping postmortem because "minor" — near-misses teach us most
- ❌ Hiding postmortems — share widely for org learning
- ❌ Blame language even when "talking about systems"

## When to Skip Postmortem

Almost never. Even for SEV4, a short writeup helps. Always do one for:
- Any SEV1 / SEV2
- Repeated SEV3+ from same root cause
- Security incidents
- Customer-facing incidents
- Data integrity issues
