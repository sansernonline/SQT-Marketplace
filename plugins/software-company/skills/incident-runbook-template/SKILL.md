# Incident Runbook Template

## When to use this skill

- Writing a runbook for a known failure mode
- Documenting on-call procedures
- Creating playbooks for common alerts
- After a postmortem identifies "we need a runbook for X"
- Onboarding new on-call engineers

## What's a Runbook?

A **runbook** answers: "Alert X fired. What do I do?"

It's NOT:
- ❌ A postmortem (that's analysis after)
- ❌ Architecture documentation (that's the bigger picture)
- ❌ Training material (too detailed)

It IS:
- ✅ Step-by-step actions
- ✅ Decision flowcharts
- ✅ Commands to copy-paste
- ✅ Escalation paths

## Runbook Quality Standards

A good runbook is:

| Property | Test |
|----------|------|
| **Actionable** | Can a tired engineer at 3am follow it? |
| **Concrete** | Are commands copy-pasteable? |
| **Tested** | Has someone followed it during a real incident? |
| **Updated** | Is the last-reviewed date < 6 months? |
| **Discoverable** | Can on-call find it from the alert link? |
| **Concise** | < 1 page for common cases |

---

## Runbook Template

```markdown
# 🚨 Runbook: <Alert Name or Failure Mode>

| | |
|--|--|
| **Severity** | 🔴 SEV1 \| 🟠 SEV2 \| 🟡 SEV3 |
| **Service** | service-name |
| **Owner Team** | @team-name |
| **Last Reviewed** | YYYY-MM-DD |
| **Linked Alert** | [Grafana/PagerDuty link] |

## 🎯 TL;DR (30 seconds)

> One paragraph: what's broken, what to do first, who to call.

## 📊 How to Detect

**Symptoms:**
- User-facing: ...
- Internal: ...

**Alerts that fire:**
- 🚨 [Alert Name](link) — fires when ...
- 🚨 [Another Alert](link) — fires when ...

**Dashboards to check:**
- 📈 [Main Dashboard](link)
- 📈 [Service Health](link)

## 🔍 Diagnosis (60 seconds)

\`\`\`mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start([Alert fires]) --> Q1{Is the service healthy in dashboard?}
    Q1 -->|No| A[Check infrastructure]
    Q1 -->|Yes| Q2{Are errors >5%?}
    Q2 -->|Yes| B[Check recent deploys]
    Q2 -->|No| Q3{Is latency high?}
    Q3 -->|Yes| C[Check downstream services]
    Q3 -->|No| D[Check alert config - may be false alarm]
\`\`\`

### Quick checks (run in order)

**1. Is service responding?**
\`\`\`bash
curl -fsS https://api.example.com/health || echo "DOWN"
\`\`\`

**2. Are recent deploys suspicious?**
\`\`\`bash
gh release list --repo our-org/service --limit 5
\`\`\`

**3. Check error rate in logs:**
\`\`\`bash
# Last 10 min of 5xx errors
kubectl logs -n prod deployment/api --since=10m | grep -c '"status":5'
\`\`\`

**4. Check downstream dependencies:**
- Database: [Dashboard link]
- Redis: [Dashboard link]
- External API: [Status page link]

## 🩹 Mitigation Steps

Try mitigations in order of risk (lowest first):

### 🟢 Step 1: Reduce load (low risk)
\`\`\`bash
# Enable rate limiting
kubectl set env deployment/api -n prod RATE_LIMIT_AGGRESSIVE=true
\`\`\`

**Expected effect:** Error rate drops within 2 min
**If doesn't work:** Go to Step 2

### 🟡 Step 2: Scale up (medium risk)
\`\`\`bash
kubectl scale deployment/api -n prod --replicas=10
\`\`\`

**Expected effect:** Latency improves within 3 min
**Caveats:** Will increase cost, monitor budget alerts

### 🟠 Step 3: Rollback recent deploy (higher risk)
\`\`\`bash
kubectl rollout undo deployment/api -n prod
\`\`\`

**Expected effect:** Reverts to previous version
**Caveats:** Loses any data created since deploy

### 🔴 Step 4: Failover to backup region (last resort)
\`\`\`bash
# Update DNS to point to backup region
./scripts/failover-to-us-west.sh
\`\`\`

**Expected effect:** All traffic shifts to backup
**Caveats:** Some user data may need migration, full rollback complex

## 📞 Escalation Path

```
You can't resolve in 15 min
  ↓
1. Page secondary on-call (PagerDuty group: team-secondary)
  ↓
You both can't in 30 min
  ↓
2. Page service owner team (team-owner)
  ↓
Still SEV1 after 45 min
  ↓
3. Page incident commander on-call (IC)
  ↓
SEV1 still active after 1h
  ↓
4. Page engineering leadership
```

## 🔁 Verification (after mitigation)

Confirm the issue is resolved:

- [ ] Error rate back to baseline
- [ ] Latency p95 < threshold
- [ ] Status page updated to "Operational"
- [ ] No new alerts firing
- [ ] Customer reports stopped
- [ ] Monitor for 30 min before considering resolved

## 📝 After Resolution

1. **Document in incident channel**: what happened, what you did
2. **Update status page**: clear incident, post resolution message
3. **Create postmortem ticket**: if SEV1/SEV2, schedule postmortem
4. **Update this runbook**: if you learned something new

## Runbook Index Pattern

Maintain a central index:

```markdown
# 📚 Runbook Index

## By Service
- [API Service](runbooks/api/)
  - [High error rate](runbooks/api/high-error-rate.md)
  - [Memory leak](runbooks/api/memory-leak.md)
- [Database](runbooks/db/)
  - [Connection pool exhausted](runbooks/db/conn-pool.md)
  - [Replication lag](runbooks/db/repl-lag.md)

## By Alert Name
| Alert | Runbook |
|-------|---------|
| `api_5xx_rate_high` | [API: High error rate](link) |
| `db_connections_high` | [DB: Connection pool](link) |
| `disk_full_warn` | [Generic: Disk full](link) |

## Most Common Incidents (last 90 days)
1. High error rate on payment service — [runbook](link) (12 times)
2. DB replication lag — [runbook](link) (8 times)
3. Cache invalidation storm — [runbook](link) (5 times)
```

---

## Linking Runbook to Alert

Every alert MUST link to a runbook:

```yaml
# Prometheus AlertManager
- alert: APIHighErrorRate
  expr: rate(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m]) > 0.05
  annotations:
    summary: "API error rate > 5%"
    runbook: "https://runbooks.example.com/api/high-error-rate"
    dashboard: "https://grafana.example.com/d/api-overview"
```

## What Makes Runbooks Fail

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Out of date | Review every 6 months, update after every incident |
| Too long | Split into multiple runbooks per failure mode |
| Too generic | Be specific to YOUR service |
| No commands | Include actual copy-paste commands |
| Not discoverable | Link from alerts, index page |
| No ownership | Each runbook has a team owner |
| Not tested | Run game days, follow during real incidents |

---

## Game Days

Test runbooks by simulating failures:

```markdown
## Game Day Checklist

Quarterly:
- [ ] Pick a runbook to test
- [ ] Simulate the failure in staging (chaos engineering)
- [ ] On-call engineer follows runbook
- [ ] Identify gaps
- [ ] Update runbook based on learnings
- [ ] Repeat with different runbook next quarter
```

## Anti-patterns

- ❌ **Theoretical runbooks** written without experiencing the failure
- ❌ **Walls of context** before any actionable step
- ❌ **"Contact the team"** without specifying who/how
- ❌ **Mitigation = root-cause fix** (mitigation should be FAST, fix is later)
- ❌ **Runbook in a wiki nobody can find** — link from alert
- ❌ **Update postmortems but not runbooks** — postmortems → runbook updates
